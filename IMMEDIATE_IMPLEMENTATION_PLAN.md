## ⚠️ Legal Considerations

### AI Employee Placement Service
**Status:** ⚠️ NEEDS LEGAL REVIEW

**Potential Issues:**
- Misrepresentation (claiming to be human)
- Contract violations (if AI not disclosed)
- Labor law compliance
- Tax implications

**Recommended Approach:**
1. **Disclose it's AI** - "AI-Powered Development Service"
2. **Freelance/Contract model** - Not "employee"
3. **Clear service terms** - What AI does vs. human oversight
4. **Legal review required** before implementation

**Alternative (Safer):**
- "AI Development Assistant Service"
- Clear that it's AI-powered
- Human oversight included
- Freelance/contract basis
