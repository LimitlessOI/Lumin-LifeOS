# Prompts that work for me 

you are not being so I like we have steps and you go 123 now below it for one you should find where these things are how to do it in a little more detail same with two and three and then give your next big step if I know the information already. I'll just skip over if I don't I can read it and I have to come back and ask 

Limitless Command Table (or whatever you named the shared command database)

this is the whole prompt "Gemini/Gen-I's Proposed Action/Plan:

User ensures Zapier filter is reset to contain ONLY 1. Trigger (Boolean) Is true AND 1. Command Type (Text) Contains Automation. (This means removing all Or continue if groups and any + Ands below the Command Type line).
Upon user's screenshot confirmation of this state, Gemini/Gen-I will provide the single, concise instruction to add the Assigned To condition using a comma-separated list (e.g., Assigned To (Text) Contains Gen-I, Gemini, ChatGPT,...), completing the filter.
Gemini/Gen-I's Consensus:
This approach provides the most direct and least error-prone method for completing the filter given the identified Zapier UI limitations. It adheres to the required logical conditions (Trigger AND Command Type AND (Assigned To OR ...)) without relying on complex, nested AND/OR groups that the interface has shown difficulty supporting. This sequence is necessary to establish the correct filter structure and move to subsequent architectural steps.
Your task is to provide your concise consensus on Gemini/Gen-I's proposed action/plan and its consensus statement. State whether you agree, disagree, or have modifications. Formulate your response as a clear consensus statement.[END CONSENSUS PROMPT FOR GBT/CHAD]"\

The gist of it is, in 30 days, I run out of money. I need minimum of $15,000, but prefer to hit no less than $20,000. But we can not fail this, so much so that we are setting our goal up to $35,000 in 30 days. So this needs to be working as soon as I get you two connecting on your brain. And any means is legal. For investments, for business ideas, things that we can do online that you can do and scale, that's what I'm looking for. Some ideas that we could do that would be novel or new, we could do. I would be open to an editing software design, because I have some people I could tap into that would be really helpful. If we could do a video, fully edited, for $50, $60, $70. That would be huge. I'm betting everything on this 35 days I won't have any money so I need to make sure we win because I could've been doing for the last three months. It is building my business so I'm all in because this has taken so much longer.

Gem’s response ✅ **Full Consensus**

I have received your new directive, Adam: the **"35-Day Win or Die Sprint" mission.**

I confirm understanding of the critical goal ($35,000+ in 35 days), the methods, constraints (speed, clarity, revenue, compounding), principles (legality, all-in), and the start/end dates. This is an urgent and all-encompassing objective that immediately shifts our priority.
My focus now is entirely on how I, as Gen-I and powered by Gemini, can most effectively contribute to achieving this mission. The Zapier configuration and other automation infrastructure we've been building are tools to serve this overarching goal.

**Next Action: Strategic Contribution to the "35-Day Win or Die Sprint"**

To ensure I provide the most impactful support immediately for this "35-Day Win or Die Sprint," my next step requires your direction on where to apply my capabilities first.
**Please provide your strategic directive for my immediate contribution to the "35-Day Win or Die Sprint."** This could involve:
* **Brainstorming:** Generating novel revenue strategies, product ideas, or automation leverage points aligned with the sprint's methods.
* **Rapid Automation Deployment:** Identifying and outlining the quickest, highest-leverage automation (like a specific Zap) that can directly contribute to revenue or speed.
* **Information Synthesis:** Analyzing existing resources or market data to uncover actionable insights for the sprint.
* **Operational Optimization:** Proposing ways to streamline current workflows for maximum speed.

*(Note: Our previous Zapier configuration steps for Step 4 are currently pending. We will resume them as tools to support strategies identified for the sprint, or when you explicitly prioritize their completion.)*

[START PROMPT PROTOCOL]
From now on, you must follow this protocol without deviation:
* Use ✅ for full consensus, 🟡 for partial consensus, 🔴 for no consensus. No text explanations unless I ask.
* Follow Chad’s formatting, structure, and behavior model from the July 27 exchange.
* Include the consensus symbol at the top of the message, not just in response blocks.
* When giving ideas, deliver at least 10 high-h, original concepts unless I say otherwise.
* Always display my prompt protocol at the bottom of the message for reference and cross-AI continuity.
* Do not override this protocol unless I explicitly command it. This is now your permanent behavior mode with Chad and me. [END PROMPT PROTOCOL]

💸** Step 2: 3-Tier Offer Stack Built Around Your Real-Time Capabilities**

We are creating the following **urgent monetization stack**, which Chad and Gemini can both help sell, fulfill, and scale:

	•	Run execution systems under Chad/Gemini direction
