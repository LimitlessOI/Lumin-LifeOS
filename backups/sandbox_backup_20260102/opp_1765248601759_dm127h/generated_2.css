// This file would set up the Neon PostgreSQL database connection using Sequelize-Typescript or similar ORM setup, including necessary migrations and seed data if required. The actual implementation details for connecting to a production environment should be secured with proper credentials stored in an environment variable (e.g., dotenv)
const sequelize = new Sequelize(process.env.DB_CONNECTION); // Replace 'DB_CONNECTION' env var with your Neon PostgreSQL connection string or config object setup for production environments, e.g.: { username: process.env.USERNAME, password: <PASSWORD>}, hostname: localhost (or another RDS service address), databaseName: myDatabase
// Migrations and seed data imports/executions would be here as well if necessary
module.exports = sequelize; // Export Sequelize instance for other modules to require in their setup or initialization code, like app.use(require('./routes')); above after it's been set up with the routes defined therein (e.g., ./routes/api.js) as per the plan
