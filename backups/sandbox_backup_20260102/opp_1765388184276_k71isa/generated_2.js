For the sake of this schema, we will assume that `name` includes a unique identifier like first name and last initial to avoid direct personal identification while still providing anonymity within our system's internal processes (e.g., progress tracking). The age field is constrained between 5-12 years old as per the requirements of this project, which align with schooling ages in most countries for language learning programs.
