#### Revenue Capture Mechanism Design & Implementation (Day 18) ####
This phase would include finalizing the integration with Stripe, setting up necessary configurations within Railway's platform-specific settings if needed and ensuring that all components are set to capture revenue accurately. This setup includes configuring endpoints for handling charge captures or processing payments through invoices where appropriate (`/api/v1/billing` etc.), implementing business rules around when charges should be captured, integrating with Stripe's API as per requirements provided above (not fully detailed here due to scope limitations).
