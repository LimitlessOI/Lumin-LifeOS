#### Stripe Integration Endpoints (Day 14-18) ####
To integrate with a service like Stripe without autonomous transactions would typically involve setting up APIs in Railway's `/api/v1` namespace to handle payment intents and charge creation endpoints, ensuring proper JWT token verification for secure access. This setup requires creating an actual Express route that constructs the necessary data payload following service-specific integration requirements with Stripe API (not provided here due to scope limitations but would typically include a POST endpoint `/api/v1/billing`, handling logic including formulating payment intent creation and retrieval requests, parsing responses from Stripe for user feedback).
