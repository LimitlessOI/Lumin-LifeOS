#### Configuration Files #### - These are files that contain environment variables specific to our project setup including API keys and Neon PostgreSQL credentials etc., which should not expose sensitive data but rather use a library like `dotenv` for secure access or generation of these dynamically at runtime. A sample structure would be as provided in the .env file above with required entries, auto-generated using `touch configs/.env`.
