#### Frontend Components #### - These are the HTML/JSX files (if using React-based components) that will present our dashboard to end users with real-time metrics display and form templates for charges or other necessary information where applicable. If generated, these would include forms preloaded with Stripe's JavaScript library as required here or in an external file referenced by `views/chargeForm.html` (optional).
