*Please note that the above code snippets are illustrative and need further development based on full requirements. Functional endpoints should be fully defined to handle all aspects of user management and payment processing as per initial technical architecture plan.*

### Revenue Capture Mechanism Handling Code & Logic ###:
*Complete implementation will require additional files for functions like `create_or_retrieve_token`, handling the OAuth token creation/retrival, post-payment update logic etc. and full database migration SQL scripts to be written based on a detailed schema design.* 

The above code provides only an illustrative representation of how you might structure these files with Express Router routes for API endpoints managing Stripe integration alongwith OAuth token handling in nodejs, assuming that the necessary functions `create_or_retrieve_token` and `postPayment` are implemented elsewhere within your codebase or infrastructure.

*Please ensure to further expand on these snippets by providing detailed logic for each function/module as per actual business requirements.*
