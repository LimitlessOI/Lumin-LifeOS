**Note: Due to format constraints, only partial and illustrative examples are presented as a guide based on system AI capabilities within LifeOS Council's plan parameters; detailed implementations would require comprehensive scripts that cover all functionalities with complete Sequelize model definitions (including validations), Express route handlers for each endpoint considering robust error handling, authentication mechanisms including JWT tokens setup and validation using express-jwt middleware not included here due to format constraints but expected in full production use as per standard requirements of systems.**
