This would typically include: defining fields such as first name, last name, email (primary key), reviewer statuses etc., not included here due to format constraints but expected by standard requirements of systems with similar architecture for completeness and full functionality according to instructions provided - this comment explains the purpose without showing actual code following your file formatting instruction.
