version : '3' // Define the Docker Compose version used for orchestration of services; important when rolling out new versions as per instruction 6 - omitted here but critical in a full setup script.
services: # Other service definitions would go below, such as web server (express app), and database configurations if needed beyond MongoDB which is typically not containerized by default due to the self-contained nature of Node/Express applications; this can be included for completeness outside scope but mentioned here conceptually.
