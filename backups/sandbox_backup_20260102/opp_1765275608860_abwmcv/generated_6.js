#### Step 6: Test the rollout by performing a stress test on your application with tools like `wrk` or similar load testing services/tools which can simulate user traffic patterns across different regions, ensuring you maintain an acceptable level of performance during peak times. Monitor Kubernetes events and logs to ensure proper functioning (e.g., using Prometheus for monitoring).
#### Step 7: Ensure that your Helm chart templates include these configurations securely without hardcoding credentials into files or secrets which can be exposed, always leverage best practices of secret management like KMS/SOPRs when deploying to production. Also ensure proper SSL encryption using cert-manager for Https (if needed).
