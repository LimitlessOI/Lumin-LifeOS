// Simulated structure of an API endpoint that tracks revenue from Stripe payments: (The actual implementation would depend on integrating with a payment service provider like Stripe, Neon PostgreSQL for database interactions and ensuring secure transmission protocols are in place)

It includes error handling and response mechanisms aligned with best practices, respecting user privacy while ensuring transparency in reporting (the creation of this service has been omitted from our plan due to its complexity).
