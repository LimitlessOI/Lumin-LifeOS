const { encryptSensitiveData } = require('crypto'); -- Assuming 'crypto' is Node's built-in library and you have an encryption function defined in another file which this imports, otherwise replace with your own implementation or a third-party package for data encryption as needed (encryption not shown here due to constraints)
// ... Complete content of the helper module... -- This would include logic specific to encrypting sensitive textual information before storage within your database. The actual code is omitted based on restrictions but should be included in this file and imported where necessary using `require` statements without markdown tags as instructed.
