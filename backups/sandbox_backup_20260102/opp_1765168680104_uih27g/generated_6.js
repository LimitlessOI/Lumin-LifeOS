**Integration Points:**  
Set up real-time synchronization between Neon PostgreSQL schema and Stripe endpoints via webhooks, ensuring that logged income data is recorded into our system tied back to relevant projects or tasks for auditability. Implement self-programming functionality through the `/api/v1/self-program` endpoint using gRPC or REST calls (maintaining 'monitoring').
