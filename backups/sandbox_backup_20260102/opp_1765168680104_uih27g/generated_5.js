**API Endpoints:**  
Develop RESTful endpoints using FastAPI within Railway for listing, creating and updating projects; managing task queues with creation logic that allows dynamic reorder based on project needs. Implement an endpoint `/api/v1/income` to log Stripe transactions by triggering webhooks without performing charges directly (maintaining 'client_management').
