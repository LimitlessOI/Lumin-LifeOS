Develop test suites using Pytest for endpoints handling various scenarios, including high traffic or transaction anomalies; simulate Neon PostgreSQL interactions to ensure data integrity under normal and stress conditions. Focus on elasticity in custom solutions provision while maintaining simple_analysis principles (maintaining 'simple_analysis').
