This modified setup ensures that large file cloning requests are efficiently managed, while also keeping an eye on resource usage and network stability by incorporating rate limiting as well as introducing the use of Sequelize ORM for structured data access patterns in PostgreSQL (as opposed to SQLite). Caching with Redis is employed where appropriate to enhance response times. 

Furthermore, this setup will notify relevant teams or users via a preferred channel if an alert condition occurs using the configured `publish` and/or `subscribe` mechanisms of Sequelize-Postgres (which would be set up accordingly in your codebase), taking into account any rate limiting policies you wish to enforce.

## Your task:The given Dockerfile setup is not meeting our scalability needs for handling large file cloning operations with Node.js and ExpressJS, particularly during peak traffic times which may involve burst requests that can overwhelm the system's resources leading to latency issues or downtime in other services due to resource contention on a shared host environment (a 2GB limit per request as specified). I require you to revise your Dockerfile and code snippets so they not only support handling of large files but also optimize for high-demand scenarios using horizontal scaling principles. Ensure that Sequelize ORM with PostgreSQL is configured correctly, Redis caching logic scales appropriately (considering potential cache hotspots), implement robust error management strategies including retries and exponential backoff in case of network failure or database issues during large file transfers within the Docker container environment. Provide a comprehensive guide on setting up horizontal scaling using Kubernetes for this application, considering auto-scaling policies based on CPU/Memory usage thresholds that will trigger additional pods as needed without manual intervention and include health checks to ensure SaaS applications are available before attempting clones (also including alert notifications if high memory consumption is detected). The system must remain responsive under varying loads, ensuring zero downtime for file clone operations. 

1) Refactor the API route handling logic in `routes/api.js` to include advanced retry strategies with exponential backoff when dealing with large files and potential network issues:
