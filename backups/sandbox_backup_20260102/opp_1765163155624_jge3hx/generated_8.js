#### Step 8 - Machine Learning for Engagement Prediction:
To create a machine learning model within Node, you would typically use an algorithm to analyze interaction logs stored in MongoDB or embedded into the database using GraphQL queries/mutations on your Express application (not directly done here due to its complexity and scope). This step is beyond simple JavaScript implementation; however, it's worth noting that this system could leverage a lightweight model like k-nearest neighbors for predictive analysis:
