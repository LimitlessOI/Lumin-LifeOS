Document: Initiate an inquiry that requires you, as Dr. Smith's assistant (a soph0metic-driven AI) within the context of a Python web application for tracking progress in learning programming languages using asynchronous code with Redis to manage session data and ensure real-time updates across multiple chat rooms where users interact through various channels like email notifications, phone calls and live streams. The app should maintain user anonymity by not storing personal identifiers but use cookies or tokens instead of plain text JWTs for state management in the authentication mechanism with a secure token generation algorithm that includes biometric verification (fingerprint scans), while ensuring full compliance with GDPR policies, all without using any external libraries. Provide detailed documentation and code snippets demonstrating how each part should function together within an Express app structure for Node.js/Express+Mongoose implementation including a dynamic difficulty adjustment mechanism that adapts to user progress analytics in real-time based on their responses during live programming challenges, with the system automatically updating learners' badges and certificates when they reach certain milestones or complete courses within this platform for Python developers. Additionally, ensure all communications are encrypted via HTTPS/TLS encryption using Node.js Crypto (cryptographic functions), while ensuring to provide a method of handling session timeouts every 24 hours with proper error-handling mechanisms and fallback procedures in case the user loses their connection? In this complex task, you need to consider several advanced features:

1. User authentication using biometric verification (fingerprint scans) - integrate a fingerprint recognition service that interfaces directly with an external API or library for secure identification before allowing access to progress tracking and JWT token generation functionalities in the backend of your web application, which I'm calling "CodeCompanion". Users can sign up using their biometrics.
2. Real-time data synchronization between a local MongoDB database (for storing course information) hosted on an AWS RDS instance with replicated and backed-up PostgreSQL databases for critical operations like enrolling in courses, submitting assignments, or receiving progress notifications. Explain how to set up the Node.js server using ExpressJS/Express-GQL integration while keeping GDPR compliance at its forefront throughout this process:

Certainly! To create a more sophsytic and detailed response that aligns with your instructions, let's break down each of these steps into individual solutions for the various components you are asking about. However, since it is not practical to execute real-time biometric authentication within this format due to its complexity—which involves integrating a third-party service or developing an in-house fingerprint scanning solution along with necessary backend services and algorithms—I'll provide pseudocode outlining the general approach you would take.

Given these requirements, here is what your setup might look like:

#### Step 1 - Setup User Registration/Login Endpoint Using Biometrics for Authentication (Node.js with Express)
Since biometric authentication using fingerprints will require integration of a secure and privacy-compliant service or hardware capabilities, we'll assume that the user has already scanned their fingerprint which is stored on an ID card linked to backend credentials in your database:
