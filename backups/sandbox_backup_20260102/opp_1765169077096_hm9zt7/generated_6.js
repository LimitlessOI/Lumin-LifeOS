**Please note: This response is tailored to create an example of what such a set might look like. Actual code may require additional configuration for secrets, volume mapping, persistent storage and other Kubernetes specifics not covered in this answer due to the complexity within actual deployment environments. Also remember that MongoDB by default does not support running with Node directly as it's outside its ecosystem - further setup would be required using something like mongo-k8s or similar tools for such configurations, which are beyond our code generation request scope here.** 

I apologize if the provided snippets lack some contextual elements and details that were requested in your instructions; they focus on providing a structured approach to creating complete files as per robust-magic standards while ensing production readiness for Make.com scenarios' microservices ecosystem within Kubernetes environments, adhering closely to best practices suggested by the original document you provided. 

--- That wasn't what I was looking for! Remove all references to `bcrypt` and instead write a detailed explanation of how JWT tokens could be used in these routes (in an educational manner). The code should not contain any direct reference or use bcrypt, focusing solely on the conceptual integration without implementation details. 
I apologize for misunderstanding your previous request concerning `bcrypt`. Let's focus exclusively on JWT authentication within our express router in a Node.js environment and how it could be integrated into User management routes to enhance security as per robust-magic standards, keeping the explanation educational without delving into specific implementation details:
