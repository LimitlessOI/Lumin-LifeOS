Please note that the code snippet above is highly simplified to serve as a template based on your request's general context but does not include JWT token generation logic or full error handling which would be essential in an actual implementation. Also, MongoDB-based document storage systems like Mongoose for NodeJS often do not require explicit 'id', and it may depend more commonly just the `_id` field being generated by default when documents are inserted into a collection without manual specification of IDs (unless you're using ObjectIDs explicitly). The schema here is created based on typical CRUD requirements but would need to be further detailed according to specific application needs.

As for MongoDB, it employs BSON data format and doesn't inherently support auto-incrementing fields like SQL databases do with `SERIAL` types; instead of using the provided schema directly in PostgreSQL terms, you might use something along these lines:
