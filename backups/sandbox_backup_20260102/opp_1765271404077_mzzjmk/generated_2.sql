CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS funnel_progresses (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    sessionId VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL, -- Unique identifier for the user's interaction within a specific session to ensure referential integrity and avoid duplicate records in our Neon PostgreSQL database tables that capture their funnel journey. This will link back to `user_interactions` through common identifiers like this unique ID or transactional keys
    currentStage TEXT NOT NULL, -- Capture the user's progress within a specific stage of our online marketing funnel for targeted optimization strategies and promotional offers based on their journey position (e.g., 'Homepage', 'Landing Page Visit') with appropriate textual descriptions or identifiers
    lastVisitedAt TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP -- Record the timestamp of when a user's interaction was captured within this table, using PostgreSQL default values and types to ensure accurate time tracking without requiring additional input parameters from users. This will help us monitor real-time progress throughout their funnel journey
);
-- ... other necessary migrations for setting up essential schema elements such as `user_interactions`, etc., if not already included in the initial plan, along with foreign key relationships and relevant constraints to maintain referential integrity within our Neon PostgreSQL database tables capturing user interactions (`userId` column) -- End of file.
