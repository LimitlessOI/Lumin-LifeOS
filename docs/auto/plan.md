# Auto Plan

Multiple forced build requests detected in a short time frame.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate build request frequency
  - rationale: Repeated forced build requests may indicate an underlying issue with the build process or a misconfiguration in the autopilot system.
  - risk: med
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review autopilot debounce settings
  - rationale: The current debounce setting may not be optimal, leading to excessive build requests in a short period.
  - risk: low
  - files: configs/autopilot/config.yaml
- 3. Implement logging for build request sources
  - rationale: Enhanced logging will help identify the source of forced build requests and improve troubleshooting.
