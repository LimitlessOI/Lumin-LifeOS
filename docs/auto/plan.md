# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with inconsistent debounce times.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and standardize debounce timing for autopilot builds
  - rationale: The logs show that the debounce times are inconsistent, ranging from 1 to 6 minutes. This inconsistency could lead to inefficient build processes and resource usage.
  - risk: low

- 2. Analyze the necessity of frequent 'build-now' triggers
  - rationale: The high frequency of 'build-now' commands suggests that the system might be over-triggering builds, which could be optimized to save resources and time.
