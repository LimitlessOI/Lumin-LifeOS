# Auto Plan

Frequent 'build-now' commands indicate potential inefficiencies in the build process.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate frequent 'build-now' triggers
  - rationale: The logs show a high frequency of 'build-now' commands, which may indicate that the build system is not operating efficiently or that there are unnecessary triggers causing builds. This could lead to resource wastage and longer build times.
  - risk: medium

- 2. Review debounce timing settings
  - rationale: The debounce messages suggest varying wait times, which may not be optimal for the current build frequency. Adjusting these settings could reduce unnecessary builds and improve system efficiency.
