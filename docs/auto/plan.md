# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with debounce messages indicating potential inefficiency.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and optimize autopilot build frequency
  - rationale: The logs show frequent build triggers by autopilot with debounce messages suggesting that builds are being initiated too often, potentially leading to resource inefficiency.
  - risk: med
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review debounce logic effectiveness
  - rationale: The debounce messages indicate that the current debounce logic may not be effectively preventing rapid successive builds, which could lead to unnecessary resource usage.
  - risk: low
