# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with debounce messages suggest possible misconfiguration.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate Autopilot Build Frequency
  - rationale: The logs show frequent 'build-now' commands with intermittent debounce messages, indicating that the autopilot might be triggering builds more often than necessary. This could lead to resource wastage and potential system strain.
  - risk: medium
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review Debounce Configuration
  - rationale: The debounce messages suggest that the system is attempting to limit build frequency, but the current settings might not be effective. Adjusting debounce timing could prevent unnecessary builds.
  - risk: low
