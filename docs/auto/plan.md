# Auto Plan

Frequent build triggers indicate potential inefficiency in the build process.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate frequent build triggers
  - rationale: The logs show that 'autopilot:build-now' is being triggered frequently, which may indicate inefficiencies or misconfigurations in the build process. This could lead to unnecessary resource usage and longer build times.

- 2. Review debounce settings
  - rationale: The debounce messages suggest that the system is attempting to manage rapid build requests, but the current settings may not be effective in reducing the frequency of builds.
