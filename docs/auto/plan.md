# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with debouncing messages.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate frequent build triggers
  - rationale: The logs show frequent 'build-now' commands, which may indicate an issue with the autopilot logic or external triggers causing unnecessary builds.
  - risk: med
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review debounce logic
  - rationale: The debounce messages suggest that the system is attempting to limit build frequency, but the effectiveness of this mechanism should be evaluated to ensure it is functioning as intended.
  - risk: low
