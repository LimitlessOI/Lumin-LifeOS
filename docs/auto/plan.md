# Auto Plan

Frequent builds indicate potential inefficiencies in the build trigger logic.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and optimize build trigger logic
  - rationale: The logs show frequent build triggers, often within short time intervals, suggesting that the debounce mechanism may not be effectively preventing unnecessary builds.
  - risk: medium
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Implement logging for build trigger sources
  - rationale: Understanding what triggers each build can help identify unnecessary or redundant triggers, allowing for more targeted optimizations.
  - risk: low
