# Auto Plan

Frequent 'build-now' commands indicate potential inefficiencies in the build process.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and optimize build triggers
  - rationale: The frequent 'build-now' commands suggest that the build system might be triggering builds unnecessarily or too frequently, which could lead to resource wastage and longer build times.
  - risk: medium
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review debounce logic
  - rationale: The debounce messages indicate attempts to reduce build frequency, but the current logic may not be effective enough given the high number of builds.
  - risk: low
