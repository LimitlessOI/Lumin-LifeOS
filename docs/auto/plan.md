# Auto Plan

Frequent builds with inconsistent debounce intervals detected.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and optimize debounce logic
  - rationale: The logs show frequent builds with inconsistent debounce intervals, which may indicate inefficiencies or misconfigurations in the debounce logic. Optimizing this can reduce unnecessary builds and improve system performance.
  - risk: med
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Implement logging improvements
  - rationale: Current logs lack detailed information on why builds are triggered so frequently. Enhanced logging can provide insights into the conditions leading to builds, aiding in better diagnosis and optimization.
