# Auto Plan

Multiple forced build requests detected in a short time frame.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate build request frequency
  - rationale: The logs show an excessive number of forced build requests in a short period, which may indicate a misconfiguration or a bug in the autopilot system.
  - risk: med
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Implement rate limiting for build requests
  - rationale: To prevent overwhelming the build system, implementing rate limiting can help manage the frequency of build requests.
  - risk: low
  - files: src/autopilot/build_manager.py
- 3. Review autopilot configuration settings
  - rationale: There may be configuration issues leading to unnecessary forced builds; reviewing these settings can help optimize the build process.
