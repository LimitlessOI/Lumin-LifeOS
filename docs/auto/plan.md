# Auto Plan

Multiple forced build requests indicate potential issues with the autopilot system.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate Autopilot Build Requests
  - rationale: The frequent forced build requests suggest that there may be an underlying issue with the autopilot's ability to trigger builds automatically, which could lead to delays in deployment.
  - risk: med

- 2. Review Debounce Mechanism
  - rationale: The debounce messages indicate that the system is limiting build requests, which may not be functioning as intended. Reviewing this mechanism could help optimize build efficiency.
  - risk: low
  - files: src/autopilot/debounce.js
- 3. Monitor Build Performance Metrics
  - rationale: To prevent future issues, setting up monitoring for build performance metrics will help identify bottlenecks and improve the overall reliability of the autopilot system.
