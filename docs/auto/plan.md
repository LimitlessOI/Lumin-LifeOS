# Auto Plan

Frequent 'build-now' commands and inconsistent debounce times indicate potential misconfiguration.

## Actions
- 1. Review and adjust debounce configuration
  - rationale: The logs show frequent 'build-now' commands with inconsistent debounce times, suggesting a possible misconfiguration that could lead to unnecessary builds and resource usage.
  - risk: low
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Implement logging for build triggers
  - rationale: Adding detailed logging for what triggers 'build-now' commands can help identify if these are legitimate or due to misconfiguration.
