# Auto Plan

Frequent build requests indicate potential issues with the build process.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate build failures
  - rationale: The logs show multiple build requests in a short time frame, suggesting that builds may be failing or not completing successfully.
  - risk: high
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Optimize build process
  - rationale: Repeated build requests may indicate inefficiencies in the current build process that need to be addressed.
  - risk: medium
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 3. Implement monitoring for build status
  - rationale: To prevent future issues, implementing monitoring will help track build success rates and alert on failures.
  - risk: low
