# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with inconsistent debounce intervals.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and standardize debounce intervals
  - rationale: The logs show that the debounce intervals vary significantly, ranging from 1 to 6 minutes. Standardizing these intervals could optimize the build process and reduce unnecessary builds.
  - risk: low

- 2. Analyze build frequency and necessity
  - rationale: The logs indicate a high frequency of builds, which may not be necessary and could lead to resource wastage. Analyzing the necessity of each build could help in optimizing the build process.
  - risk: medium
