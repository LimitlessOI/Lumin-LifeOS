# Auto Plan

Autopilot build process is being triggered repeatedly without clear outcomes.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate build triggers
  - rationale: To understand why the build process is being initiated multiple times in a short period, which may indicate an issue with the autopilot configuration or a potential bug.
  - risk: med
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review build logs for errors
  - rationale: To identify any errors or warnings in the build logs that could explain the repeated build requests.
  - risk: low
  - files: logs/build.log
- 3. Optimize build scheduling
  - rationale: To prevent unnecessary builds and improve resource utilization by adjusting the scheduling of the autopilot.
