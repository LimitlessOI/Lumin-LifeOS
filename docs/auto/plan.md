# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with inconsistent debounce intervals.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and standardize debounce intervals
  - rationale: The logs show inconsistent debounce intervals, which may lead to unnecessary builds and resource usage. Standardizing these intervals can optimize the build process.
  - risk: low

- 2. Analyze build frequency and necessity
  - rationale: Frequent builds may indicate an issue with the autopilot's decision-making process. Analyzing the necessity of each build can help reduce redundant operations.
