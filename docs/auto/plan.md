# Auto Plan

Multiple forced build requests indicate potential issues with the autopilot system.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate Autopilot Build Requests
  - rationale: The frequent forced build requests suggest that the autopilot may not be functioning as intended, leading to potential inefficiencies or errors in the build process.
  - risk: med

- 2. Review Debounce Timing Configuration
  - rationale: The debounce messages indicate that the system is limiting build requests, which may need adjustment to improve responsiveness.
  - risk: low
  - files: configs/autopilot/config.yaml
- 3. Monitor Build Success Rates
  - rationale: To ensure the reliability of the build process, it is crucial to monitor the success rates of builds initiated by the autopilot.
