# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with inconsistent debounce intervals.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and standardize debounce intervals
  - rationale: The logs indicate inconsistent debounce intervals which may lead to unnecessary builds and resource usage. Standardizing the debounce time can optimize the build process.
  - risk: low

- 2. Analyze build frequency necessity
  - rationale: Frequent builds may not be necessary and could be optimized to reduce resource consumption. Analyzing the necessity of each build can help in reducing redundant builds.
