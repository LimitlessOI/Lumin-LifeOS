# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot indicate possible inefficiencies.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate frequent build triggers
  - rationale: The logs show frequent 'build-now' commands, which may indicate inefficiencies or misconfigurations in the autopilot system. This could lead to unnecessary resource usage and increased build times.
  - risk: med

- 2. Review debounce settings
  - rationale: The debounce messages suggest that the system is attempting to manage build frequency, but the current settings may not be effective. Reviewing and adjusting these settings could help reduce unnecessary builds.
