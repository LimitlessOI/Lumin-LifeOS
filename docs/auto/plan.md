# Auto Plan

Frequent 'build-now' commands suggest potential inefficiency in the build process.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and optimize build trigger conditions
  - rationale: The logs show frequent 'build-now' commands, which may indicate that the build system is triggering builds too often, potentially due to overly sensitive conditions or misconfigurations. Optimizing these conditions can reduce unnecessary builds, saving resources and time.
  - risk: medium
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Implement enhanced logging for build triggers
  - rationale: Adding detailed logging for build triggers can help identify the specific conditions or changes that are causing frequent builds. This information is crucial for diagnosing and addressing the root cause of the issue.
