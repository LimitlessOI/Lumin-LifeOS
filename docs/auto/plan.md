# Auto Plan

Frequent 'build-now' commands indicate potential inefficiencies in the build process.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and optimize build triggers
  - rationale: The high frequency of 'build-now' commands suggests that the build system might be triggering builds more often than necessary, potentially due to inefficient change detection or configuration issues.
  - risk: medium
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Enhance debounce logic
  - rationale: The debounce messages indicate that the system is trying to prevent too frequent builds, but the current logic might not be sufficient to handle the load effectively.
  - risk: low
