# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with varying debounce times.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate frequent build triggers
  - rationale: The logs show a high frequency of 'autopilot:build-now' events, which may indicate unnecessary builds being triggered. This could lead to resource wastage and potential delays in the build pipeline.
  - risk: medium
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review debounce logic
  - rationale: The debounce times vary significantly, suggesting that the logic determining these times might need refinement to ensure optimal build scheduling and resource utilization.
  - risk: low
