# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered with minimal debounce time.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate frequent build triggers
  - rationale: The logs show a high frequency of 'build-now' commands with minimal debounce time, which may indicate unnecessary builds or misconfiguration in the build trigger logic.
  - risk: med
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Adjust debounce timing
  - rationale: The debounce times vary significantly and are often very short, leading to frequent builds. Adjusting these times could help in reducing the load on the build system.
  - risk: low
