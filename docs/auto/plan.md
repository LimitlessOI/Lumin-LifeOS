Multiple forced build requests detected in a short time frame.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate build system responsiveness
  - rationale: The frequent forced build requests may indicate a problem with the build system's responsiveness or a misunderstanding of the build process.
  - risk: med
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Implement rate limiting for build requests
  - rationale: To prevent overwhelming the build system, implementing rate limiting can help manage the frequency of build requests.
  - risk: high
  - files: src/autopilot/build_manager.py
- 3. Review and update build documentation
  - rationale: Ensuring that users understand the build process can reduce unnecessary forced requests.
