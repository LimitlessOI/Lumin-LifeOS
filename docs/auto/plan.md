# Auto Plan

Multiple forced build requests detected in a short time frame.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate build request frequency
  - rationale: The logs indicate an unusually high number of forced build requests in a short period, which may suggest an issue with the build system or user behavior.
  - risk: med
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Implement rate limiting for build requests
  - rationale: To prevent potential overload on the build system, implementing rate limiting can help manage the frequency of build requests.
  - risk: high
  - files: src/autopilot/build_manager.py
- 3. Review user training on build requests
  - rationale: If the high frequency of forced builds is due to user error or misunderstanding, additional training may be necessary.
  - risk: low
