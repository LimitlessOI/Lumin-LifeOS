# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with varying debounce times.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate frequent build triggers
  - rationale: The logs indicate that the autopilot is triggering builds very frequently, sometimes within minutes of each other. This could lead to resource exhaustion or unnecessary build overhead.
  - risk: medium
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review debounce logic
  - rationale: The debounce messages suggest varying wait times, but builds are still being triggered frequently. This inconsistency needs to be reviewed to ensure the debounce logic is correctly implemented.
