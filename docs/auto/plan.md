# Auto Plan

Multiple build requests detected from autopilot.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate build request frequency
  - rationale: The autopilot is triggering build requests in quick succession, which may indicate a misconfiguration or an issue that needs addressing.
  - risk: med
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review autopilot configuration
  - rationale: To prevent excessive build requests, it's essential to ensure that the autopilot's configuration aligns with expected behavior.
  - risk: low
  - files: configs/autopilot/config.yaml
- 3. Monitor build performance
  - rationale: Frequent builds can impact system performance; monitoring will help assess the impact and optimize resource usage.
