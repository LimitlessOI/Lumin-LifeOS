# Auto Plan

Frequent 'build-now' commands with inconsistent debounce times indicate potential misconfiguration.

## Actions
- 1. Review and adjust debounce configuration
  - rationale: The logs show frequent 'build-now' commands followed by varying debounce times, which suggests that the debounce logic might not be functioning as intended. This could lead to unnecessary builds and resource usage.
  - risk: low
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Implement logging for debounce logic
  - rationale: Adding detailed logging around the debounce logic will help diagnose why debounce times are inconsistent and ensure that the logic is functioning correctly.
