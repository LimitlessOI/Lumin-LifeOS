# Auto Plan

Frequent forced build requests indicate potential issues with the build process.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate build failures
  - rationale: The high frequency of forced build requests suggests that there may be underlying issues causing builds to fail or take too long, which need to be addressed.
  - risk: high
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review debounce settings
  - rationale: The debounce messages indicate that the system is limiting build requests. Adjusting these settings may improve responsiveness.
  - risk: med
  - files: config/autopilot/config.yaml
- 3. Enhance logging for build processes
  - rationale: Improved logging can provide better insights into build failures and performance issues.
