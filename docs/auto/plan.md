# Auto Plan

Frequent 'build-now' commands indicate potential issues with the autopilot's debounce mechanism.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate Autopilot Debounce Logic
  - rationale: The logs show frequent 'build-now' commands followed by 'debounce debounced' messages, suggesting that the debounce mechanism might not be effectively preventing redundant builds.
  - risk: medium
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Monitor Build Frequency
  - rationale: The high frequency of builds could indicate an underlying issue with the build trigger conditions or the debounce timing.
  - risk: low
