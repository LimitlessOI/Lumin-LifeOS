# Auto Plan

Frequent 'build-now' commands indicate potential misconfiguration or excessive triggering.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and adjust debounce settings
  - rationale: The logs show frequent 'build-now' commands with minimal debounce intervals, suggesting that the debounce mechanism may not be effectively preventing redundant builds.
  - risk: low

- 2. Analyze build trigger conditions
  - rationale: The high frequency of 'build-now' commands could be due to overly sensitive or incorrect trigger conditions, leading to unnecessary builds.
