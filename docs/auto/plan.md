# Auto Plan

Frequent 'build-now' commands indicate potential inefficiency in the build process.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and optimize build triggers
  - rationale: The high frequency of 'build-now' commands suggests that the build system may be triggering builds unnecessarily, which can lead to resource wastage and longer build times.
  - risk: medium
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review debounce logic
  - rationale: The debounce messages indicate that the system is attempting to manage build frequency, but the current logic may not be effective enough given the number of builds.
  - risk: low
