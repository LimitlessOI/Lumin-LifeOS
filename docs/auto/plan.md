# Auto Plan

Frequent forced build requests indicate potential issues with the build process.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate Build Failures
  - rationale: The logs show multiple forced build requests, suggesting that the builds may be failing or not completing as expected.
  - risk: high
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review Debounce Logic
  - rationale: The debounce messages indicate that the system is limiting build requests, which may be causing delays in processing.
  - risk: med
  - files: src/autopilot/debounce.js
- 3. Enhance Logging for Build Process
  - rationale: Improved logging can help identify the root cause of the issues leading to forced builds.
