# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with inconsistent debounce times.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and standardize debounce timing
  - rationale: The logs show inconsistent debounce times ranging from 1 to 6 minutes. Standardizing this could optimize build frequency and resource usage.
  - risk: low

- 2. Analyze build frequency necessity
  - rationale: Frequent builds may indicate a need for optimization in the build trigger logic to prevent unnecessary resource consumption.
