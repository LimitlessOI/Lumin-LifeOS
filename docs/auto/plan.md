# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with inconsistent debounce times.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and standardize debounce timing in autopilot
  - rationale: The logs show frequent builds with varying debounce times, which may indicate a misconfiguration or bug in the debounce logic. Standardizing debounce times can prevent unnecessary builds and optimize resource usage.

- 2. Analyze build frequency and necessity
  - rationale: The high frequency of builds suggests that the current configuration might be triggering builds more often than necessary, potentially leading to resource wastage.
