# Auto Plan

Frequent 'build-now' commands indicate potential inefficiency in build triggering.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and optimize build trigger logic
  - rationale: The frequent 'build-now' commands suggest that the build system may be triggering builds more often than necessary, which can lead to resource wastage and longer build queues.
  - risk: medium
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review debounce timing configuration
  - rationale: The debounce messages indicate varying wait times, which may not be optimal for the current build frequency and could be contributing to inefficiencies.
