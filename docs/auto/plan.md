# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with varying debounce times.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate frequent build triggers
  - rationale: The logs show a high frequency of 'build-now' commands, which may indicate an issue with the autopilot's build trigger logic or unnecessary builds being initiated.
  - risk: med

- 2. Analyze debounce logic
  - rationale: The debounce times vary significantly, suggesting potential inconsistencies in how debounce is applied. This could lead to inefficient build scheduling.
