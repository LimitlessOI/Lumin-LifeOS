# Auto Plan

Multiple forced build requests indicate potential issues with the autopilot system.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate Autopilot Build Failures
  - rationale: The frequent forced build requests suggest that the autopilot may not be functioning as intended, leading to potential build failures or delays.
  - risk: high
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review Debounce Logic
  - rationale: The logs show multiple debounce messages, indicating that the system is not processing builds efficiently. Reviewing the debounce logic may help optimize build requests.
  - risk: med
  - files: src/autopilot/debounce.js
- 3. Monitor Build Performance
  - rationale: Establishing monitoring for build performance can help identify patterns or issues in the build process over time.
  - risk: low
