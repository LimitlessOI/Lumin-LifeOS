# Auto Plan

Frequent 'build-now' commands indicate potential misconfiguration or excessive triggering.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate frequent 'build-now' triggers
  - rationale: The logs show 'build-now' commands being triggered frequently, which may indicate a misconfiguration or an issue with the triggering mechanism that could lead to unnecessary resource usage.
  - risk: med

- 2. Review debounce settings
  - rationale: The log entry 'debounce debounced: please wait ~5 min' suggests that the debounce mechanism is in place but might not be effectively preventing frequent builds.
