# Auto Plan

Multiple forced build requests detected, indicating potential issues with the build process.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate build failures
  - rationale: The repeated forced build requests suggest that the previous builds may have failed or are taking too long, which needs immediate attention.
  - risk: high
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review build logs for errors
  - rationale: Analyzing the build logs will help identify the root cause of the failures and prevent future occurrences.
  - risk: med
  - files: logs/build_errors.log
- 3. Implement build timeout alerts
  - rationale: Setting up alerts for builds that exceed a certain duration can help in proactively managing build issues.
  - risk: low
  - files: configs/alerts.yml
