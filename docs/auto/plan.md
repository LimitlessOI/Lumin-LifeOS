# Auto Plan

Frequent build triggers with inconsistent debounce intervals.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate inconsistent debounce intervals
  - rationale: The logs show varying debounce intervals (1 min, 3 min, 5 min, 6 min) which may indicate a misconfiguration or bug in the debounce logic, potentially leading to unnecessary builds and resource usage.

- 2. Optimize build frequency
  - rationale: Frequent builds (often within minutes of each other) suggest that the build trigger criteria might be too sensitive, leading to resource wastage.
