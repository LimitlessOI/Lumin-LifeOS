# Auto Plan

Multiple forced build requests indicate potential issues with the build process.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate build failures
  - rationale: The repeated forced build requests suggest that the previous builds may have failed or are taking too long, requiring immediate investigation to ensure stability.
  - risk: high

- 2. Review build logs
  - rationale: Analyzing the build logs will help identify any errors or warnings that could explain the need for multiple forced builds.
  - risk: med
  - files: logs/build.log
- 3. Optimize build process
  - rationale: If the build process is consistently slow or failing, optimizing it could prevent future issues and improve efficiency.
