# Auto Plan

Frequent 'build-now' commands with inconsistent debounce times.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and standardize debounce timing
  - rationale: The logs show inconsistent debounce times ranging from 1 to 6 minutes, which may indicate a misconfiguration or bug in the debounce logic. Standardizing this can prevent unnecessary builds and optimize resource usage.
  - risk: med

- 2. Implement logging for build triggers
  - rationale: The frequent 'build-now' commands suggest that the system might be reacting to frequent changes or misinterpreting triggers. Enhanced logging can help identify the root cause of these frequent builds.
