# Auto Plan

Frequent build requests indicate potential issues with the autopilot system.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate Autopilot Build Frequency
  - rationale: The logs show an excessive number of 'build-now' requests, suggesting that the autopilot may not be functioning as intended or is stuck in a loop.
  - risk: med
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review Debounce Logic
  - rationale: The debounce messages indicate that the system is trying to manage build requests, but the timing may need adjustment to prevent overload.
  - risk: low
  - files: src/autopilot/debounce.js
- 3. Monitor System Performance
  - rationale: To ensure that the system can handle the load, monitoring performance metrics during build requests will help identify bottlenecks.
