# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with inconsistent debounce times.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and standardize debounce timing in autopilot
  - rationale: The logs show inconsistent debounce times, ranging from 1 to 6 minutes, which may indicate a configuration issue or a bug in the debounce logic. Standardizing this can help in reducing unnecessary builds and improving system efficiency.

- 2. Analyze build frequency and necessity
  - rationale: The frequent 'build-now' commands suggest that builds are being triggered very often, potentially leading to resource wastage. Analyzing the necessity of each build can help optimize resource usage.
