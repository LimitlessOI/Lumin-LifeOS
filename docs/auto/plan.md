# Auto Plan

Frequent forced build requests indicate potential issues with the autopilot system.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate Autopilot Build Failures
  - rationale: The logs show multiple forced build requests, suggesting that the autopilot may not be functioning as intended, leading to user frustration and potential delays.
  - risk: high
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review Debounce Logic
  - rationale: The debounce messages indicate that the system is trying to manage build requests but may not be effective, which could lead to unnecessary delays.
  - risk: med
  - files: src/autopilot/debounce.js
- 3. Enhance Logging for Build Processes
  - rationale: Improved logging can help diagnose issues with the build process and provide better insights into the frequency and reasons for forced builds.
  - risk: low
