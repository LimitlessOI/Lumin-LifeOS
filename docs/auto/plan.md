# Auto Plan

Frequent 'build-now' commands suggest potential inefficiencies in the build process.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate frequent 'build-now' triggers
  - rationale: The logs show a high frequency of 'build-now' commands, which may indicate unnecessary builds or a misconfiguration in the autopilot system. This could lead to resource wastage and increased build times.
  - risk: medium

- 2. Review debounce timing
  - rationale: The debounce messages indicate varying wait times, which might not be optimal. Reviewing and standardizing debounce timing could improve build efficiency.
