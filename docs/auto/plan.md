# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with debouncing delays.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate frequent build triggers
  - rationale: The logs show a high frequency of 'build-now' commands, which could indicate unnecessary builds being triggered. This might lead to resource wastage and increased build times.
  - risk: med

- 2. Review debounce timing logic
  - rationale: The debounce times vary significantly, suggesting potential inconsistencies in the logic or configuration. Ensuring consistent debounce behavior can optimize build scheduling.
