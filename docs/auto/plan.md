# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered with inconsistent debounce times.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and standardize debounce timing
  - rationale: The logs show inconsistent debounce times, which could lead to unnecessary builds and resource usage. Standardizing debounce times can optimize build processes.
  - risk: low

- 2. Analyze build triggers for optimization
  - rationale: Frequent 'build-now' triggers suggest potential inefficiencies or misconfigurations in the build trigger logic. Analyzing these triggers can help reduce redundant builds.
