# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with inconsistent debounce times.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and standardize debounce timing
  - rationale: The logs show inconsistent debounce times ranging from 1 to 6 minutes, which may lead to unnecessary builds and resource usage. Standardizing debounce timing can optimize build frequency and resource allocation.

- 2. Analyze build frequency and necessity
  - rationale: The high frequency of 'build-now' commands suggests potential inefficiencies. Analyzing the necessity of each build can help reduce redundant processes and improve system performance.
