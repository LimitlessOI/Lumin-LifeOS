Frequent forced build requests indicate potential issues with the autopilot system.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate Autopilot Build Frequency
  - rationale: The logs show multiple forced build requests in a short time frame, suggesting possible underlying issues with the build process or configuration.
  - risk: med
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review Debounce Mechanism
  - rationale: The debounce messages indicate that the system is trying to manage build requests, which may not be functioning optimally.
  - risk: low
  - files: src/autopilot/debounce.js
- 3. Monitor Build Performance
  - rationale: To understand the impact of frequent builds, monitoring build performance metrics will help identify any bottlenecks.
