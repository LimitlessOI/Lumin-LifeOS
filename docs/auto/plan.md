# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with inconsistent debounce times.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and optimize debounce logic in autopilot
  - rationale: The logs show frequent builds with varying debounce times, suggesting potential inefficiencies or misconfigurations in the debounce logic. Optimizing this could reduce unnecessary builds and improve system performance.
  - risk: medium
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Implement logging for build triggers
  - rationale: Adding detailed logging for why builds are triggered can help diagnose if the frequent builds are necessary or if there are underlying issues causing them.
  - risk: low
