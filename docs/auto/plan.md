# Auto Plan

Frequent 'build-now' commands suggest potential inefficiency in the build process.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate frequent 'build-now' triggers
  - rationale: The logs show a high frequency of 'build-now' commands, which may indicate inefficiencies or misconfigurations in the build trigger logic. Understanding the cause can help optimize the build process and reduce unnecessary builds.
  - risk: low

- 2. Review debounce logic effectiveness
  - rationale: The debounce messages suggest attempts to limit build frequency, but the frequent 'build-now' commands indicate it may not be effective. Reviewing and potentially adjusting the debounce logic could improve build efficiency.
