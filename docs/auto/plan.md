# Auto Plan

Multiple build requests detected in a short time frame.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate build triggers
  - rationale: Frequent build requests may indicate an issue with the build automation or a misconfiguration in the autopilot settings.
  - risk: med
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review build logs for errors
  - rationale: To ensure that the builds are completing successfully and to identify any underlying issues.
  - risk: low
  - files: logs/builds/latest_build.log
- 3. Set up rate limiting for build requests
  - rationale: To prevent excessive build requests that could overload the system and impact performance.
  - risk: high
