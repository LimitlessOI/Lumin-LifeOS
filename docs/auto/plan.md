# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with inconsistent debounce times.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and standardize debounce timing
  - rationale: The logs show inconsistent debounce times ranging from 1 to 6 minutes, which may lead to unnecessary builds and resource usage. Standardizing the debounce time can optimize build frequency and resource allocation.

- 2. Analyze build frequency and necessity
  - rationale: The high frequency of 'build-now' commands suggests that builds may be triggered more often than necessary, potentially due to misconfigurations or overly sensitive triggers.
