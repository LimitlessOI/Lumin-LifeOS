# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with inconsistent debounce times.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and optimize debounce logic in autopilot
  - rationale: The logs show frequent builds with varying debounce times, suggesting potential inefficiencies or misconfigurations in the debounce logic. Optimizing this could reduce unnecessary builds and improve system performance.

- 2. Implement logging for build triggers
  - rationale: Adding detailed logging for why builds are triggered can help diagnose issues and optimize the build process.
