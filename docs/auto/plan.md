# Auto Plan

Frequent forced build requests indicate potential issues with the build system.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate Build System Performance
  - rationale: The logs show multiple forced build requests in a short time frame, suggesting that the build system may be experiencing delays or failures.
  - risk: high
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review Debounce Logic
  - rationale: The debounce messages indicate that the system is trying to manage build requests, but frequent forced builds may suggest that the debounce logic is not functioning as intended.
  - risk: med
  - files: src/autopilot/debounce.js
- 3. Monitor Build Queue
  - rationale: To understand the build request patterns and identify any bottlenecks, monitoring the build queue will provide insights into the system's performance.
  - risk: low
