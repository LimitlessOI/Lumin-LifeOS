# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with inconsistent debounce times.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and standardize debounce timing
  - rationale: The logs show inconsistent debounce times ranging from 1 to 6 minutes, which may lead to unnecessary builds and resource usage. Standardizing debounce timing can optimize build frequency and resource allocation.

- 2. Analyze build triggers
  - rationale: Frequent 'build-now' commands suggest potential misconfiguration or excessive triggering conditions. Analyzing the triggers can help identify and eliminate unnecessary builds.
