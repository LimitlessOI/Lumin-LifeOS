# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with inconsistent debounce times.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and optimize debounce logic
  - rationale: The logs show frequent 'build-now' commands with varying debounce times, which may indicate inefficiencies or misconfigurations in the debounce logic. Optimizing this could reduce unnecessary builds and improve system performance.

- 2. Implement logging for build triggers
  - rationale: Adding detailed logging for why builds are triggered can help diagnose issues with the autopilot system and improve future optimizations.
