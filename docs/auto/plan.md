# Auto Plan

Frequent 'build-now' commands indicate potential inefficiency in build triggering.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and optimize build trigger logic
  - rationale: The logs show frequent 'build-now' commands, suggesting that the build system may be triggering builds more often than necessary, which could lead to resource wastage and increased costs.
  - risk: med

- 2. Implement logging for build trigger reasons
  - rationale: Adding detailed logging for why each 'build-now' is triggered will help in diagnosing and optimizing the build process.
