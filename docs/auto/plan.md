# Auto Plan

Multiple forced build requests detected in a short time frame.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate build request frequency
  - rationale: High frequency of forced build requests may indicate an underlying issue or misconfiguration in the build system.
  - risk: med
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Implement rate limiting for build requests
  - rationale: To prevent potential overload on the build system, implementing rate limiting can help manage the frequency of build requests.
  - risk: low
  - files: src/autopilot/build_manager.py
- 3. Review autopilot configuration settings
  - rationale: Ensure that the autopilot settings are correctly configured to avoid unnecessary forced builds.
