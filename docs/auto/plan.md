# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with inconsistent debounce intervals.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and standardize debounce intervals
  - rationale: The logs show varying debounce intervals, which could lead to inefficient build processes and resource usage. Standardizing these intervals can optimize the build process.
  - risk: low

- 2. Analyze build frequency and necessity
  - rationale: The high frequency of 'build-now' commands suggests potential overuse or misconfiguration of the autopilot system. Analyzing the necessity of each build can help reduce unnecessary builds.
