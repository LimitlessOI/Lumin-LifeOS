# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot indicate potential inefficiency.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and optimize build trigger conditions
  - rationale: The logs show frequent 'build-now' commands, suggesting that the current conditions for triggering builds may be too sensitive or not well-defined, leading to unnecessary builds and resource usage.
  - risk: low

- 2. Implement a more effective debounce strategy
  - rationale: The current debounce messages indicate varying wait times, which may not be effectively preventing rapid successive builds. A more consistent and effective debounce strategy could help manage build frequency better.
