# Auto Plan

Frequent 'build-now' commands indicate potential inefficiencies in the build process.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and optimize build frequency
  - rationale: The logs show a high frequency of 'build-now' commands, often following 'debounce' messages. This suggests that the build system might be triggering builds too frequently, which could lead to resource wastage and longer build times.
  - risk: medium
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review debounce logic
  - rationale: The debounce messages suggest that the system is attempting to manage build frequency, but the subsequent 'build-now' commands indicate it might not be effective. Improving debounce logic could prevent unnecessary builds.
