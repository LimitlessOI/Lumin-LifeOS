# Auto Plan

Frequent 'build-now' commands indicate potential inefficiencies in the build process.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and optimize build frequency
  - rationale: The logs show a high frequency of 'build-now' commands, suggesting that the build process might be triggered more often than necessary, leading to potential inefficiencies and resource wastage.
  - risk: medium
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review debounce logic
  - rationale: The debounce messages indicate varying wait times, which may not be effectively preventing redundant builds. A consistent and optimized debounce strategy could reduce unnecessary builds.
