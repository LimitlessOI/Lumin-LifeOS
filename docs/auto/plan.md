# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with inconsistent debounce intervals.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and standardize debounce intervals
  - rationale: The logs show inconsistent debounce intervals ranging from 1 to 6 minutes, which may lead to unnecessary builds and resource usage. Standardizing the debounce interval can optimize build frequency and resource allocation.

- 2. Analyze build frequency and necessity
  - rationale: The high frequency of 'build-now' commands suggests potential inefficiencies or misconfigurations in the autopilot system. Analyzing the necessity of each build can help reduce redundant operations.
