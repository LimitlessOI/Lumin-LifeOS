# Auto Plan

Multiple forced build requests detected in a short time frame.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate build request frequency
  - rationale: To understand why multiple forced build requests were initiated in quick succession, which may indicate a potential issue or misconfiguration.
  - risk: med
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Implement rate limiting for build requests
  - rationale: To prevent excessive build requests that could overload the system and ensure stability.
  - risk: high
  - files: src/autopilot/build_manager.py
- 3. Review autopilot configuration settings
  - rationale: To ensure that the autopilot settings are correctly configured to avoid unnecessary forced builds.
  - risk: low
  - files: configs/autopilot_config.yaml
