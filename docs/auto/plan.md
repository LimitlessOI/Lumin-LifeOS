# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with debounce warnings.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate frequent build triggers
  - rationale: The logs indicate that builds are being triggered very frequently, often within minutes of each other. This could be due to an issue with the autopilot configuration or an external factor causing unnecessary builds.
  - risk: medium
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review debounce mechanism effectiveness
  - rationale: The debounce mechanism is intended to prevent excessive builds by introducing a wait time. However, the logs show builds occurring shortly after debounce warnings, suggesting it may not be effective.
