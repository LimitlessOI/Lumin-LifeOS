# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with inconsistent debounce times.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and standardize debounce timing in autopilot
  - rationale: The logs show frequent 'build-now' commands with varying debounce times, which could indicate a misconfiguration or inefficiency in the autopilot's debounce logic. Standardizing this could optimize build frequency and resource usage.

- 2. Analyze build frequency and resource utilization
  - rationale: The high frequency of builds may lead to unnecessary resource consumption. Analyzing the necessity and impact of each build can help in optimizing the build process.
