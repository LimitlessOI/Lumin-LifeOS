# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with inconsistent debounce intervals.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and standardize debounce intervals
  - rationale: The logs show varying debounce intervals, which may lead to unnecessary builds and resource usage. Standardizing these intervals can optimize the build process.
  - risk: low

- 2. Analyze build triggers for optimization
  - rationale: Frequent 'build-now' triggers suggest potential inefficiencies or misconfigurations in the autopilot system. Analyzing these triggers can help reduce redundant builds.
