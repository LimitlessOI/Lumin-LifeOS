# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with inconsistent debounce times.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and standardize debounce logic
  - rationale: The logs show inconsistent debounce times, which could lead to unnecessary builds and resource usage. Standardizing debounce logic will ensure efficient build scheduling.

- 2. Analyze build frequency requirements
  - rationale: Frequent builds may indicate a misconfiguration or a need for more efficient build triggers. Analyzing the necessity of each build can optimize resource usage.
