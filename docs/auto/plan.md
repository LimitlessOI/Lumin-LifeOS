# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with inconsistent debounce times.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and standardize debounce timing in autopilot
  - rationale: The logs show frequent builds with varying debounce times, which could lead to unnecessary resource usage and potential system strain. Standardizing debounce timing can optimize build frequency and resource allocation.
  - risk: medium

- 2. Implement logging for build triggers
  - rationale: Understanding the reasons behind each 'build-now' trigger can help in optimizing the build process and identifying unnecessary builds.
  - risk: low
