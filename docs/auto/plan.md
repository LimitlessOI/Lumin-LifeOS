# Auto Plan

Frequent 'build-now' commands suggest potential inefficiencies in the build process.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and optimize build frequency
  - rationale: The logs show a high frequency of 'build-now' commands, which may indicate inefficiencies or misconfigurations in the build process. Optimizing the build frequency could reduce resource usage and improve system performance.
  - risk: medium

- 2. Review debounce logic
  - rationale: The debounce messages suggest varying wait times, which could be inconsistent or suboptimal. Reviewing the debounce logic could ensure more consistent and efficient build triggering.
