# Auto Plan

Frequent 'build-now' commands indicate potential inefficiencies in the build process.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate frequent 'build-now' triggers
  - rationale: The logs show a high frequency of 'build-now' commands, which may indicate that the build process is being triggered more often than necessary. This could be due to misconfigurations or unnecessary triggers.
  - risk: low

- 2. Review debounce timing
  - rationale: The debounce messages suggest varying wait times, which might not be effectively preventing rapid successive builds. Standardizing or optimizing debounce times could improve efficiency.
