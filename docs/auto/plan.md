Frequent forced build requests indicate potential issues with the autopilot system.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate Autopilot Build Frequency
  - rationale: The logs show a high frequency of forced build requests, which may indicate underlying issues with the build process or configuration.
  - risk: med
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review Debounce Mechanism
  - rationale: The debounce messages suggest that the system is trying to manage build requests but may not be functioning optimally.
  - risk: low
  - files: src/autopilot/debounce.js
- 3. Enhance Logging for Build Failures
  - rationale: Improved logging can help identify the reasons behind the forced builds and any failures that may occur.
