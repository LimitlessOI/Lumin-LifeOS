# Auto Plan

Frequent 'build-now' commands indicate potential inefficiencies in the build process.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and optimize build triggers
  - rationale: The logs show frequent 'build-now' commands, suggesting that the build system might be triggering builds more often than necessary, which could lead to resource wastage and increased costs.
  - risk: medium
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review debounce logic
  - rationale: The debounce messages indicate varying wait times, which might not be effectively preventing rapid successive builds. Ensuring consistent and effective debounce logic could help in reducing redundant builds.
