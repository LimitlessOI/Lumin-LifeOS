# Auto Plan

Frequent 'build-now' commands indicate potential inefficiency in the build process.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and optimize build triggers
  - rationale: The logs show frequent 'build-now' commands, suggesting that the build system may be triggering builds more often than necessary. This could lead to resource wastage and increased build times.
  - risk: medium
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review debounce logic
  - rationale: The debounce messages indicate varying wait times, which might not be effectively reducing redundant builds. A consistent and effective debounce strategy could improve efficiency.
