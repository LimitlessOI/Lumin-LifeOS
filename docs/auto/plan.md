# Auto Plan

Frequent 'build-now' commands indicate potential automation inefficiency.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate frequent 'build-now' triggers
  - rationale: The logs show multiple 'build-now' commands in a short period, which may indicate an inefficiency in the build automation process or unnecessary manual interventions.
  - risk: medium
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Implement debounce mechanism for 'build-now'
  - rationale: A debounce mechanism could prevent redundant builds and reduce resource usage by ensuring 'build-now' commands are not triggered too frequently.
  - risk: low
