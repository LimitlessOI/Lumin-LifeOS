# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with debouncing delays.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate frequent build triggers
  - rationale: The logs show frequent 'build-now' triggers by autopilot, which may indicate an issue with the triggering mechanism or an overly aggressive build policy. This could lead to unnecessary resource usage and longer build queues.
  - risk: medium

- 2. Review debounce timing configuration
  - rationale: The debounce messages indicate varying wait times, suggesting that the debounce logic might not be consistent or optimal. Ensuring consistent debounce timing can help manage build frequency more effectively.
