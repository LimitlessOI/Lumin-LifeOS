# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with inconsistent debounce times.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and standardize debounce timing
  - rationale: The logs show that the debounce times are inconsistent, ranging from 1 to 6 minutes. This inconsistency could lead to inefficient build processes and resource usage.
  - risk: low

- 2. Analyze build frequency and necessity
  - rationale: The logs indicate a high frequency of 'build-now' commands, which may not be necessary and could be optimized to reduce resource usage and improve system efficiency.
