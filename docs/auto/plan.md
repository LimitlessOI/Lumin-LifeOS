# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered with inconsistent debounce intervals.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and standardize debounce intervals
  - rationale: The logs show inconsistent debounce intervals ranging from 1 to 6 minutes, which may indicate a configuration issue or a bug in the debounce logic. Standardizing these intervals can help in maintaining consistent build triggers and resource utilization.

- 2. Analyze build frequency and resource usage
  - rationale: The frequent 'build-now' triggers suggest a high build frequency that could lead to resource strain. Analyzing the necessity and impact of this frequency can help optimize resource usage and improve system efficiency.
