Frequent 'build-now' commands indicate potential inefficiency in the build process.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate frequent 'build-now' triggers
  - rationale: The logs show a high frequency of 'build-now' commands, which may indicate inefficiencies or unnecessary builds. This could lead to resource wastage and increased build times.
  - risk: medium
