# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with inconsistent debounce intervals.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and standardize debounce intervals
  - rationale: The logs show inconsistent debounce intervals ranging from 1 to 6 minutes, which may indicate a misconfiguration or bug in the debounce logic. Standardizing the debounce interval can help reduce unnecessary builds and optimize resource usage.

- 2. Analyze build frequency and necessity
  - rationale: The high frequency of 'build-now' commands suggests that builds are being triggered too often, potentially leading to resource wastage. Analyzing the necessity of each build can help in optimizing the build process.
