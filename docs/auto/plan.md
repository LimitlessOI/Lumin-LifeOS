# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with inconsistent debounce intervals.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and standardize debounce intervals
  - rationale: The logs show inconsistent debounce intervals ranging from 1 to 6 minutes, which may lead to unnecessary builds and resource usage. Standardizing these intervals could optimize build frequency and resource allocation.
  - risk: low

- 2. Analyze build triggers for potential optimizations
  - rationale: The high frequency of 'build-now' commands suggests that the autopilot may be overly sensitive to changes or events. Analyzing the triggers could help identify unnecessary builds and optimize the build process.
