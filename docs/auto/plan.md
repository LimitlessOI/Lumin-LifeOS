# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with inconsistent debounce times.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and standardize debounce timing
  - rationale: The logs show inconsistent debounce times ranging from 1 to 6 minutes, which may indicate a configuration issue or a bug in the debounce logic. Standardizing this could improve build efficiency and resource utilization.

- 2. Analyze build frequency and necessity
  - rationale: The high frequency of builds ('build-now' commands) suggests that the autopilot might be triggering builds more often than necessary, potentially leading to resource wastage. Analyzing the necessity of each build could optimize the process.
