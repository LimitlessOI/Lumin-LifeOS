# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with inconsistent debounce times.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and standardize debounce timing
  - rationale: The logs show inconsistent debounce times ranging from 1 to 6 minutes, which could lead to unnecessary builds and resource usage. Standardizing debounce times can optimize build frequency and resource utilization.

- 2. Analyze build triggers for optimization
  - rationale: Frequent 'build-now' commands suggest that the triggers for builds might be too sensitive or not well-defined. Analyzing and possibly refining these triggers could reduce unnecessary builds.
