# Auto Plan

Frequent 'build-now' commands indicate potential inefficiencies in the build process.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate frequent 'build-now' triggers
  - rationale: The logs show a high frequency of 'build-now' commands, which may indicate inefficiencies or unnecessary builds that could be optimized.
  - risk: medium
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review debounce logic
  - rationale: The debounce messages suggest that the system is attempting to manage build frequency, but the effectiveness of this logic should be reviewed to ensure it is functioning as intended.
  - risk: low
