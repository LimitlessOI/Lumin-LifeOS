# Auto Plan

Frequent 'build-now' commands suggest potential inefficiencies in the build process.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and optimize build triggers
  - rationale: The logs show frequent 'build-now' commands, which may indicate that the build system is being triggered more often than necessary, potentially due to inefficient or overly sensitive triggers.
  - risk: medium
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review debounce logic
  - rationale: The debounce messages suggest that the system is trying to prevent frequent builds, but the current logic may not be effective enough, leading to unnecessary builds.
  - risk: low
