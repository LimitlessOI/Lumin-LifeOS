# Auto Plan

Frequent 'build-now' commands indicate potential inefficiency in the build process.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and optimize build frequency
  - rationale: The logs show a high frequency of 'build-now' commands, which may indicate inefficiencies or unnecessary builds. Optimizing the build triggers could reduce resource usage and improve system performance.
  - risk: medium

- 2. Review debounce logic
  - rationale: The debounce messages suggest attempts to limit build frequency, but the current logic may not be effective given the number of builds still occurring. Adjusting debounce logic could further reduce unnecessary builds.
