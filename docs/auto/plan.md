# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with inconsistent debounce intervals.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and standardize debounce intervals
  - rationale: The logs show inconsistent debounce intervals ranging from 1 to 6 minutes, which may lead to unnecessary builds and resource usage. Standardizing these intervals can optimize the build process.

- 2. Analyze build frequency and resource utilization
  - rationale: Frequent 'build-now' commands suggest high resource usage. Analyzing the necessity and impact of these builds can help in optimizing resource allocation.
