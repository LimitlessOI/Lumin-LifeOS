# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with inconsistent debounce times.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and standardize debounce logic
  - rationale: The logs show inconsistent debounce times ranging from 1 to 6 minutes, which may indicate a misconfiguration or bug in the debounce logic. Standardizing this can prevent unnecessary builds and optimize resource usage.

- 2. Analyze build frequency and necessity
  - rationale: The high frequency of 'build-now' commands suggests that the system might be over-triggering builds. Analyzing the necessity of each build can help in reducing redundant builds and improving system efficiency.
