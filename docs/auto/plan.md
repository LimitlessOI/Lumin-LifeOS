# Auto Plan

Frequent 'build-now' commands suggest potential inefficiency in the build process.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and optimize build triggers
  - rationale: The logs show frequent 'build-now' commands, which may indicate that the build system is being triggered more often than necessary. This could lead to resource wastage and longer build times.
  - risk: medium
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review debounce logic
  - rationale: The debounce messages suggest that the system is trying to limit build frequency, but the effectiveness of this logic should be reviewed to ensure it is functioning as intended.
  - risk: low
