# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with inconsistent debounce intervals.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and standardize debounce intervals
  - rationale: The logs show inconsistent debounce intervals ranging from 1 to 6 minutes, which may lead to inefficient build processes and resource usage. Standardizing these intervals could improve system performance and predictability.
  - risk: low

- 2. Analyze build frequency and necessity
  - rationale: The high frequency of 'build-now' commands suggests potential overuse of resources. Analyzing whether all these builds are necessary could optimize resource allocation and reduce costs.
