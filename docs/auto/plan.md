Multiple forced build requests indicate potential issues with the build process.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate Build Process
  - rationale: The frequent forced build requests suggest that there may be underlying issues causing the builds to fail or not trigger as expected.
  - risk: high
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review Debounce Mechanism
  - rationale: The debounce messages indicate that the system is preventing builds from being triggered too frequently, which may need adjustment.
  - risk: med
  - files: src/autopilot/debounce.js
- 3. Enhance Logging for Build Failures
  - rationale: Improving logging will help in diagnosing the reasons behind the forced builds and any failures that occur.
