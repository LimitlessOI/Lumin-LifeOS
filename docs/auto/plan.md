# Auto Plan

Autopilot build requests are being frequently triggered with debounce messages indicating delays.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate Autopilot Build Frequency
  - rationale: The logs show an excessive number of 'build-now' requests in a short time frame, which may indicate a misconfiguration or a bug in the autopilot system.
  - risk: med
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review Debounce Logic
  - rationale: The debounce messages suggest that the system is struggling to manage build requests efficiently. Reviewing the debounce logic may help optimize performance.
  - risk: low

- 3. Monitor Build Performance
  - rationale: To ensure system stability, it's important to monitor the performance of the builds triggered by the autopilot, especially during peak times.
