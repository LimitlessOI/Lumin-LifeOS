# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with inconsistent debounce intervals.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and standardize debounce intervals
  - rationale: The logs show inconsistent debounce intervals, which could lead to unnecessary builds and resource usage. Standardizing these intervals can optimize build frequency and resource allocation.
  - risk: low

- 2. Implement logging for build triggers
  - rationale: Adding detailed logging for what triggers each 'build-now' command can help diagnose if builds are being triggered unnecessarily or if there are patterns that need addressing.
