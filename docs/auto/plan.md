# Auto Plan

Frequent build requests indicate potential issues with the build system.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate build request frequency
  - rationale: The logs show an excessive number of 'build-now' requests in a short time frame, which may indicate a malfunction or misconfiguration in the build system.
  - risk: med
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review debounce settings
  - rationale: The debounce log suggests that the system is attempting to manage build requests, but the frequency indicates it may not be functioning as intended.
  - risk: low
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 3. Monitor build performance
  - rationale: To ensure the build system is stable and performing as expected, ongoing monitoring is necessary following the investigation.
