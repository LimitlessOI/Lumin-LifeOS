# Auto Plan

Frequent build requests detected from autopilot.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate build triggers
  - rationale: The autopilot is issuing multiple build requests in a short period, which may indicate a misconfiguration or a bug.
  - risk: med
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review build performance
  - rationale: Repeated build requests could lead to resource exhaustion or delays in deployment.
  - risk: med
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 3. Implement rate limiting for builds
  - rationale: To prevent excessive build requests from the autopilot, implementing rate limiting can help manage resources effectively.
