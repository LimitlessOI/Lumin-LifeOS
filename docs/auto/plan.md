# Auto Plan

Frequent 'build-now' commands suggest potential inefficiency in the build process.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and optimize build triggers
  - rationale: The logs show frequent 'build-now' commands, which may indicate that the build system is being triggered too often, potentially due to inefficient or overly sensitive triggers. This could lead to unnecessary resource consumption and longer build times.

- 2. Implement more effective debounce logic
  - rationale: The current debounce logic seems to be ineffective in preventing frequent builds, as indicated by the short debounce times and subsequent 'build-now' commands. Improving this logic could help in reducing redundant builds.
