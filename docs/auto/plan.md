# Auto Plan

Frequent 'build-now' commands indicate potential inefficiencies in the build process.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and optimize build frequency
  - rationale: The logs show a high frequency of 'build-now' commands, which may indicate inefficiencies or unnecessary builds being triggered. Optimizing the build process could reduce resource usage and improve system performance.
  - risk: medium
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review debounce settings
  - rationale: The debounce messages suggest varying wait times, which might not be effectively preventing redundant builds. Reviewing and standardizing these settings could lead to more efficient build scheduling.
