# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with debouncing delays.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate frequent build triggers
  - rationale: The logs show frequent 'build-now' commands, often followed by debouncing messages. This suggests that the autopilot system might be triggering builds too frequently, potentially due to misconfiguration or unnecessary changes being detected.
  - risk: medium
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Optimize debouncing logic
  - rationale: The debouncing messages indicate that the system is attempting to manage the frequency of builds, but the intervals vary widely. Optimizing this logic could improve system efficiency and reduce resource usage.
