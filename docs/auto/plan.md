# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with inconsistent debounce timings.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and standardize debounce timing
  - rationale: The logs show inconsistent debounce timings ranging from 1 to 6 minutes, which may indicate a misconfiguration or bug in the debounce logic. Standardizing this timing can improve build efficiency and resource usage.

- 2. Analyze build frequency and necessity
  - rationale: The high frequency of 'build-now' commands suggests that builds are being triggered too often, potentially leading to unnecessary resource consumption. Analyzing the necessity of each build can help optimize the process.
