Multiple forced build requests indicate potential issues with the build process.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate build failures

- 2. Review autopilot configuration
  - rationale: The frequent forced build commands may indicate a misconfiguration in the autopilot settings that needs to be addressed to prevent future issues.
  - risk: med
  - files: docs/auto/configuration.md
- 3. Implement build monitoring
  - rationale: To prevent similar issues in the future, implementing a monitoring system for build processes can help catch failures early.
