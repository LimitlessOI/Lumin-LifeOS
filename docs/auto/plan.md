# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with inconsistent debounce times.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and standardize debounce timing
  - rationale: The logs show inconsistent debounce times ranging from 1 to 6 minutes, which may lead to unnecessary builds and resource usage. Standardizing debounce timing can optimize build frequency and resource allocation.
  - risk: low

- 2. Analyze build triggers for optimization
  - rationale: Frequent 'build-now' commands suggest that the triggers for builds may need optimization to prevent redundant builds and improve efficiency.
