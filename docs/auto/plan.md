# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with inconsistent debounce times.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and standardize debounce timing for autopilot builds
  - rationale: The logs show frequent builds with varying debounce times, which could lead to inefficient resource utilization and potential system overload. Standardizing debounce timing can help manage build frequency more effectively.
  - risk: low

- 2. Analyze the necessity of frequent builds
  - rationale: The high frequency of 'build-now' commands suggests that builds are being triggered very often, possibly unnecessarily. Analyzing the necessity of each build can help optimize the build process and reduce system load.
