# Auto Plan

Frequent build requests indicate potential issues with the autopilot system.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate Autopilot Build Frequency
  - rationale: The logs show an excessive number of 'build-now' requests, suggesting a possible malfunction or misconfiguration in the autopilot system.
  - risk: med
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review Debounce Logic
  - rationale: The debounce messages indicate that the system is trying to manage build requests but may not be functioning optimally.
  - risk: low
  - files: src/autopilot/debounce.js
- 3. Monitor System Performance
  - rationale: To ensure that the system can handle the load of frequent builds, monitoring performance metrics is essential.
