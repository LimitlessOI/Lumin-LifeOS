# Auto Plan

Autopilot build process is being triggered repeatedly.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate build triggers
  - rationale: Repeated build triggers may indicate a misconfiguration or an issue with the autopilot system that needs to be addressed to prevent unnecessary resource usage.
  - risk: med
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review build logs for errors
  - rationale: Checking the build logs can help identify if there are any errors causing the autopilot to trigger builds frequently.
  - risk: low
  - files: logs/build.log
- 3. Optimize build schedule
  - rationale: If builds are being triggered too frequently without significant changes, optimizing the build schedule can save resources.
