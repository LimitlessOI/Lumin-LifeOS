# Auto Plan

Frequent 'build-now' commands indicate potential inefficiency in the build process.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate frequent 'build-now' triggers
  - rationale: The logs show a high frequency of 'build-now' commands, which may indicate inefficiencies or misconfigurations in the build process that could be optimized to reduce resource usage and improve performance.
  - risk: medium
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review debounce timing settings
  - rationale: The debounce messages suggest varying wait times, which may not be effectively preventing unnecessary builds. Reviewing and standardizing these settings could help in reducing redundant builds.
