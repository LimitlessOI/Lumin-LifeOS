# Auto Plan

Frequent 'build-now' commands indicate potential misconfiguration or excessive triggering.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate frequent 'build-now' triggers
  - rationale: The logs show a high frequency of 'build-now' commands, which may indicate a misconfiguration or an issue with the triggering mechanism. This could lead to unnecessary resource usage and potential delays in the build pipeline.
  - risk: medium

- 2. Review debounce settings
  - rationale: The debounce messages suggest varying wait times, which may not be optimal for the current build frequency. Reviewing and standardizing debounce settings could improve efficiency.
