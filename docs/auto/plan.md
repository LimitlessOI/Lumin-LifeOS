# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with inconsistent debounce intervals.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and standardize debounce intervals
  - rationale: The logs show inconsistent debounce intervals ranging from 1 to 6 minutes, which may lead to unnecessary builds and resource usage. Standardizing these intervals can optimize build frequency and resource allocation.

- 2. Analyze the necessity of frequent 'build-now' triggers
  - rationale: The high frequency of 'build-now' triggers suggests potential inefficiencies or misconfigurations in the autopilot system. Analyzing the necessity and conditions for these triggers can help reduce redundant builds.
