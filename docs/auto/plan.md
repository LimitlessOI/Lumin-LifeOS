# Auto Plan

Frequent build requests indicate potential issues with the autopilot system.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate Autopilot Build Frequency
  - rationale: The logs show an excessive number of 'build-now' requests, suggesting that the autopilot may not be functioning as intended or is stuck in a loop.
  - risk: high
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review Debounce Logic
  - rationale: The debounce messages indicate that the system is trying to limit build requests, but the frequency of 'build-now' calls suggests it may not be effective.
  - risk: med
  - files: src/autopilot/debounce.js
- 3. Monitor System Performance
  - rationale: To understand the impact of the frequent builds, we need to monitor system performance metrics during these periods.
  - risk: low
