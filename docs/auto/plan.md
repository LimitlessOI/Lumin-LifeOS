# Auto Plan

Frequent build requests indicate potential issues with the autopilot system.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate Autopilot Build Frequency
  - rationale: The logs show an excessive number of 'build-now' requests, which may indicate a malfunction or misconfiguration in the autopilot system.
  - risk: med
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review Debounce Logic
  - rationale: The debounce messages suggest that the system is not effectively managing build requests, leading to user frustration and potential resource waste.
  - risk: med
  - files: src/autopilot/debounce.js
- 3. Monitor System Performance
  - rationale: To ensure the stability of the build system, monitoring should be implemented to track build performance and request frequency.
  - risk: low
