# Auto Plan

Frequent 'build-now' commands indicate potential inefficiency in the build process.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and optimize build frequency
  - rationale: The logs show a high frequency of 'build-now' commands, which may indicate inefficiencies or unnecessary builds. Optimizing the build process can save resources and time.
  - risk: medium

- 2. Review debounce settings
  - rationale: The debounce messages suggest varying wait times, which may not be effectively reducing build frequency. Reviewing and standardizing these settings could improve efficiency.
