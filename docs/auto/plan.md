# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with inconsistent debounce times.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and standardize debounce timing
  - rationale: The logs show inconsistent debounce times ranging from 1 to 6 minutes, which may indicate a misconfiguration or bug in the debounce logic. Standardizing this can prevent unnecessary builds and optimize resource usage.

- 2. Analyze build frequency and necessity
  - rationale: The high frequency of 'build-now' commands suggests potential inefficiencies or misconfigurations in the build triggering mechanism. Evaluating the necessity of each build can help reduce redundant operations.
