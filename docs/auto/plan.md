# Auto Plan

Frequent 'build-now' commands indicate potential inefficiencies in the build process.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate frequent 'build-now' triggers
  - rationale: The logs show a high frequency of 'build-now' commands, which may indicate that the system is not efficiently managing build triggers, leading to unnecessary builds and resource usage.
  - risk: medium
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review debounce logic
  - rationale: The debounce messages suggest varying wait times, which might not be effectively preventing rapid successive builds. Reviewing and standardizing debounce logic could improve system efficiency.
