# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with inconsistent debounce times.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and standardize debounce timing
  - rationale: The logs show inconsistent debounce times, which may lead to unnecessary builds and resource usage. Standardizing the debounce timing can optimize the build process.
  - risk: low
