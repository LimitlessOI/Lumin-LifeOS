# Auto Plan

Frequent 'build-now' commands suggest potential inefficiencies in the build process.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate frequent 'build-now' triggers
  - rationale: The logs show a high frequency of 'build-now' commands, which may indicate inefficiencies or misconfigurations in the build triggering logic. This could lead to unnecessary resource usage and longer build times.
  - risk: med

- 2. Review debounce logic
  - rationale: The debounce messages suggest that the system is attempting to manage build frequency, but the frequent 'build-now' commands imply that the debounce logic might not be effective. Adjusting this could improve build efficiency.
