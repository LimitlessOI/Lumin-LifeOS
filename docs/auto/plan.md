# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered with inconsistent debounce intervals.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and standardize debounce intervals
  - rationale: The logs show inconsistent debounce intervals ranging from 1 to 6 minutes, which may indicate a configuration issue or a bug in the debounce logic. Standardizing these intervals can improve build efficiency and resource utilization.

- 2. Review build trigger conditions
  - rationale: The frequent 'build-now' commands suggest that builds are being triggered very often, potentially leading to unnecessary resource usage. Reviewing the conditions that trigger builds can help optimize the build process.
