# Auto Plan

Frequent build requests detected, indicating potential issues with the build process.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate Build Frequency
  - rationale: The logs show multiple 'build-now' requests in quick succession, which may indicate a problem with the build process or a misconfiguration in the autopilot settings.
  - risk: med

- 2. Review Autopilot Configuration
  - rationale: To prevent excessive build requests, the autopilot configuration should be reviewed for any misconfigurations or thresholds that may need adjustment.
  - risk: low
  - files: docs/auto/configuration.md
- 3. Monitor Build Performance
  - rationale: Establishing monitoring for build performance can help identify if the build process is taking longer than expected, leading to repeated build requests.
