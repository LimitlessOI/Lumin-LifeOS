# Auto Plan

Multiple build requests indicate potential issues with the autopilot system.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate build request frequency
  - rationale: The logs show multiple 'build-now' requests in a short time frame, suggesting possible issues with the autopilot's decision-making process.
  - risk: med
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 2. Review debounce functionality
  - rationale: The debounce message indicates that the system is attempting to manage build requests, but the frequency suggests it may not be effective.
  - risk: low
  - files: src/autopilot/debounce.js
- 3. Enhance logging for build requests
  - rationale: Improved logging can help identify the triggers for frequent build requests and assist in troubleshooting.
