# Auto Plan

Frequent 'build-now' commands indicate potential inefficiency in the build process.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate frequent 'build-now' triggers
  - rationale: The logs show a high frequency of 'build-now' commands, which may indicate inefficiencies or unnecessary builds. Understanding the cause can help optimize the build process.
  - risk: low

- 2. Review debounce timing logic
  - rationale: The debounce messages suggest varying wait times, which might not be effectively reducing the frequency of builds. Reviewing and standardizing debounce logic could improve efficiency.
