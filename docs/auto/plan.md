# Auto Plan

Frequent builds triggered by autopilot with inconsistent debounce intervals.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate and adjust debounce logic
  - rationale: The logs show frequent 'build-now' triggers with varying debounce intervals, which may indicate an issue with the debounce logic not effectively reducing build frequency.
  - risk: med

- 2. Implement logging for debounce decisions
  - rationale: Adding detailed logging for debounce decisions will help in understanding why certain debounce intervals are chosen, aiding in debugging and optimization.
