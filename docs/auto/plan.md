# Auto Plan

Frequent forced build requests indicate potential issues with the autopilot system.

## Actions
- 1. Investigate Autopilot Build Frequency
  - rationale: The logs show an excessive number of forced build requests in a short time frame, suggesting a possible malfunction or misconfiguration in the autopilot system.
  - risk: high

- 2. Review Debounce Mechanism
  - rationale: The debounce messages indicate that the system is trying to manage build requests, but the frequency of forced builds may be overwhelming it.
  - risk: med
  - files: docs/auto/TODO.md
- 3. Monitor System Performance
  - rationale: To ensure the stability of the build process, monitoring system performance during build requests will help identify bottlenecks or failures.
