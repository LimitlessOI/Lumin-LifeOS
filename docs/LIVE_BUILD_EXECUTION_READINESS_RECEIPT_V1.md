<!-- SYNOPSIS: Live Build Execution Readiness Receipt V1 -->

# Live Build Execution Readiness Receipt V1

**Status:** `READINESS AUDIT` — validation only; no runtime code modified; no live build executed in this mission  
**Date:** 2026-06-14  
**Agent:** Composer (Cursor) — **Live Build Execution Readiness Authority**  
**Environment:** `/Users/adamhopkins/Projects/Lumin-LifeOS`  
**Mode:** Auditing and validation only  
**Runtime code modified:** **NO**

**Question:** Can the canonical execution path produce a **valid `completion_receipt_id` today?

**Answer:** **NO** — path is structurally wired but **terminal completion grant is blocked/deferred** on the production kernel-managed chain. Governed jobs may reach `job.status='committed'` without ever issuing `completion_receipt_id`.

## Readiness verdict

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Can produce `completion_receipt_id` today?** | **NO** |
| **Can reach git commit on zone-legal target?** | **LIKELY YES** (code path exists; not live-proven in this mission) |
| **Can reach `job.status='committed'`?** | **PARTIALLY** — only if zone 1/2 + `/build` success + outcome verify pass |
| **Mission verdict** | **BLOCKER** |

## Step-by-step chain audit

Classification key:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **VERIFIED** | Code + live receipt evidence agree step works in production |
| **PARTIALLY VERIFIED** | Step runs in some cases; terminal proof missing or split authority |
| **UNVERIFIED** | Code exists; no production receipt proves end-to-end success for this step |
| **BLOCKED** | Step cannot succeed on canonical path today for stated goal |

| Step | Status | Evidence | Blocker / gap |
|------|--------|----------|---------------|
| **1. Founder Intent** | **PARTIALLY VERIFIED** | Voice Rail accepts founder commands; staged rows + job creation proven (`CAP-T14`–`T16` in `VOICE_RAIL_CAPABILITY_PROOF.json`) | No receipt links founder instruction text → final `completion_receipt_id` |
| **2. Voice Rail** | **VERIFIED** | `executeVoiceRailFounderCommand()` → `createCommandControlJob()` + `executeCommandControlJob()` (`voice-rail-command-executor.js` L241–275); capability proof PASS | Routes to CC; does not itself grant completion |
| **3. Command Control** | **VERIFIED** | Jobs API create/execute; governed loop entry; CC preflight + claim gate in `executeCommandControlJob()` | Job may terminate `blocked`/`failed` before build |
| **4. Governed Loop** | **PARTIALLY VERIFIED** | OIL → PBB → `/build` dispatch; outcome verify before `committed` (`builderos-governed-loop-executor.js` L303–445) | **BLOCKED** for zone 3 targets at OIL (`ZONE3_PATCH_REQUIRED`); execute fallback still present (FAIL_OPEN risk) |
| **5. `/builder/build`** | **PARTIALLY VERIFIED** | Canonical route kernel-wrapped (`lifeos-council-builder-routes.js` L2457); CC dispatch uses `task_id=cc-{jobId}` | Zone 3 never called; non-kernel path hits DONE gate early |
| **6. Commit SHA** | **PARTIALLY VERIFIED** | `commitToGitHub()` inside `buildAndCommit`; governed loop reads `json.committed` + `commit_sha` | Commits can occur while terminal completion blocked (`committed_but_not_complete` class) |
| **7. DONE Evidence** | **BLOCKED** | Kernel records `recordBuildStart` / `recordBuildComplete` / `canMarkBuildDone` (`tsos-platform-kernel.js` L200–273) | Route **defers** DONE check when `kernelManaged` (`done_gate_deferred_to_kernel`); live history shows `BUILDEROS_DONE_BLOCKED: missing_proof:token_receipt,build_end_time,oil_receipt` on non-deferred path; **no live ledger row proof** attached to this audit |
| **8. Completion Authority** | **BLOCKED** | `grantBuildCompletion()` exists (`builderos-completion-authority.js`); feature flag default ON | On kernel path route returns `completion_deferred_to_kernel: true`, `completion_receipt_id: null` (`lifeos-council-builder-routes.js` L315–331); **kernel does not call `grantBuildCompletion`** (grep: zero matches in `tsos-platform-kernel.js`) |
| **9. `completion_receipt_id`** | **BLOCKED** | Receipt ID generator exists (`buildCompletionReceiptId`) | **Zero** `completion_receipt_id` values in `products/receipts/**`; governed loop sets `job.status='committed'` from outcome verify **without** requiring completion receipt |

---

## Split-terminal authority (why step 9 fails)

Three layers can disagree on “success” today:

```
Layer A — /build HTTP response (kernel-managed):
  ok: true, committed: true
  completion_deferred_to_kernel: true
  completion_receipt_id: null

Layer B — Kernel measurement:
  recordBuildComplete may soft-fail (kernel_strict default)
  canMarkBuildDone advisory when not strict

Layer C — Governed loop:
  job.status = 'committed' if outcome verify passes
  (no completion_receipt_id required)
```

Council reconciliation U-02/U-03 confirmed: **terminal unification not done**. This audit confirms **`completion_receipt_id` is not producible on the canonical kernel-wrapped path** without implementation work (kernel → `grantBuildCompletion` after evidence).

---

## 1. FIRST BLOCKER

**For the stated mission goal (`completion_receipt_id`):**  
**Step 8 — Completion Authority** — deferred on kernel-managed `/build`; kernel never invokes `grantBuildCompletion()`.

**For the most common founder proof targets (large files):**  
**Step 4 — Governed Loop OIL boundary** — `ZONE3_PATCH_REQUIRED` stops the job before `/builder/build` is called (`builderos-governed-loop-executor.js` L309–315; `builderos-patch-mode-policy.js` threshold 150 lines).

**Ordering:** Zone policy fires **first** on typical scripts; completion deferral fires **first** on the completion-receipt question even when zone 1/2 builds commit.

---

## 2. HIGHEST CONFIDENCE STEP

**Voice Rail → Command Control job creation and dispatch.**

Evidence:
- Static + live capability proof (`VOICE_RAIL_CAPABILITY_PROOF.json`: `CAP-T16_command_routes_to_builder_job`, `founder_commands_execute_via_command_control`)
- Code path: `createCommandControlJob` → `executeCommandControlJob` (`voice-rail-command-executor.js`)

This step is **VERIFIED** in production for routing intent into the governed chain.

---

## 3. LOWEST CONFIDENCE STEP

**Completion Authority → valid `completion_receipt_id`.**

Evidence against readiness:
- Kernel path explicitly defers with `completion_receipt_id: null`
- No production receipt contains `completion_receipt_id`
- Governed loop terminal state does not depend on completion grant
- Feasibility audit flags “completion authority terminally unified” as **HIGH RISK** assumption (`EXECUTION_CONSOLIDATION_FEASIBILITY_V1.md`)

Confidence that a **valid, linked, auditable `completion_receipt_id`** emits today: **very low (~5%)**.

---

## 4. WHAT EVIDENCE IS STILL MISSING

| # | Missing evidence | Why it matters |
|---|------------------|----------------|
| E1 | **One live zone 1/2 CC job** with full HTTP + job poll capture | Proves whether commit + ledger + response fields align |
| E2 | **`build_task_ledger` row** for `task_id=cc-{jobId}` with `token_receipt_id`, `oil_receipt_id`, `build_end_time` | Resolves U-03 kernel measurement dispute |
| E3 | **`completion_receipt_id` in `/build` response or job `result_json`** | Direct proof of mission goal |
| E4 | **Deploy SHA on `main` matching commit_sha** after governed job | Closes infra → delivery loop |
| E5 | **Negative control:** zone 3 target → `blocked` + no `/build` call | Confirms OIL gate honest (blocker plan T2) |
| E6 | **Kernel strict-mode run** (`kernel_strict=true`) success/fail matrix | Shows whether soft-fail hides DONE gaps |

This mission produced **documentation-only** readiness classification. **E1–E4 require a live keyed production test** (explicitly out of scope for “no implementation” slice).

---

## 5. WHAT SINGLE LIVE TEST WOULD REMOVE THE MOST UNCERTAINTY

**One governed command-control job on a zone 1 target** (new file under `products/receipts/`, ≤50 lines), with:

```json
{
  "task_id": "cc-{jobId}",
  "target_file": "products/receipts/LIVE_BUILD_PROOF_{timestamp}.json",
  "task": "Write minimal JSON proof artifact with schema live_build_proof_v1",
  "required_outcome": "{ explicit expected content }"
}
```

**Capture after execute:**
1. Job poll: `status`, `blocker`, `result_json.builder_output.commit_sha`
2. `/build` raw response: `completion_deferred_to_kernel`, `completion_receipt_id`, `kernel_receipts`
3. DB or API: `build_task_ledger` row for `task_id`
4. Git: `main` contains commit SHA

**Single uncertainty removed:** Whether **any** permutation of the canonical path can emit `completion_receipt_id` — expected answer **NO**, confirming implementation blocker with primary evidence instead of code inference.

---

## 6. IF A LIVE BUILD FAILED TOMORROW, WHERE WOULD IT FAIL FIRST

| Scenario | First failure point | Symptom |
|----------|---------------------|---------|
| **Default founder script target** (e.g. 361-line proof runner) | Governed loop OIL boundary | `job.status=blocked`, `ZONE3_PATCH_REQUIRED`, no `/build` |
| **Zone 1/2 small file target** | `/build` or post-commit terminal | Likely `200 committed` with `completion_receipt_id: null`; job may still reach `committed` via outcome verify |
| **Direct `/builder/build` without kernel** (non-canonical) | DONE gate before completion | `409 BUILDEROS_DONE_BLOCKED: missing_proof:*` |
| **Control plane RED + strict** | Kernel preflight | `409 KERNEL_BUILD_BLOCKED: measurement_coverage_red` |

**Most probable first failure for Adam-style proof commands:** **ZONE3_PATCH_REQUIRED** (historical pattern in `data/builder-failure-lessons.jsonl`).

**Most probable first failure for zone-legal build seeking completion receipt:** **Completion deferred** — build may “succeed” at loop layer without valid `completion_receipt_id`.

---

## 7. WHAT SHOULD CODEX REVIEW NEXT

**Mission:** `KERNEL_COMPLETION_WIRING_TRACE_V1`

Trace the kernel-managed `/build` success path in production code and answer:

1. After `recordBuildComplete`, what **must** happen for `grantBuildCompletion()` to run? (Today: nothing calls it.)
2. Does `evaluateBuildCompletionForBuildResponse(..., kernelManaged: true)` **permanently** skip grant on all success responses?
3. What is the **smallest wiring change** that preserves OIL + outcome verify order while emitting `completion_receipt_id`?
4. Does governed loop `job.status='committed'` **contradict** a `/build` 409 from kernel strict mode?

**Do not implement** — file-by-file call graph + sequence diagram only.

---

## 8. WHAT SHOULD CLAUDE REVIEW NEXT

**Mission:** `COMPLETION_AUTHORITY_KERNEL_INTEGRATION_V1` (implementation)

Implement the smallest safe repair validated by Codex trace:

- Kernel calls `grantBuildCompletion()` after successful `recordBuildComplete` + `canMarkBuildDone` evidence
- `/build` response includes `completion_receipt_id` when granted
- Governed loop **requires** `completion_receipt_id` (or explicit blocker) before `job.status='committed'`
- Tests: kernel defer removed; zone 1 integration test; regression on `BUILDEROS_COMPLETION_AUTHORITY=0` break-glass

Aligns with `CANONICAL_BUILD_EXECUTION_PATH_V1.md` §5 smallest repair and Council reconciliation item #35.

---

## 9. WHAT SHOULD C2.5 REVIEW NEXT

**Mission:** `LIVE_BUILD_PROOF_RUN_V1` (execution)

Run the single live test defined in §5 above on production (`https://robust-magic-production.up.railway.app`), produce:

- `products/receipts/LIVE_BUILD_PROOF_RUN_V1.json` — per-gate timestamps, HTTP bodies, job id, SHA, ledger fields
- Append one paragraph to this doc § "Live run appendix" with PASS/FAIL

**Prerequisite:** Founder authorization for one trivial zone-1 commit artifact (or use existing empty receipt template pattern).

If live run confirms `completion_receipt_id: null` → hand off to Claude integration mission; **do not** bypass ZONE3.

---

## Authority cross-check (consolidation audits)

| Audit claim | Readiness alignment |
|-------------|---------------------|
| One SAFE path: governed loop + outcome verify | **PARTIALLY VERIFIED** — SAFE for wrong-outcome, not for completion receipt |
| 42 authorities → 6 survivors | Completion survivor **built, not terminal** on kernel path |
| `/builder/execute` bypass | Still present as governed fallback — **not retired**; invalidates “single chain” until gated |
| Infra connected | **VERIFIED** — orthogonal to completion receipt |
| Paper vs runtime: single completion writer | **CONFIRMED MISMATCH** — this receipt’s BLOCKER verdict |

---

## Gate sequence reference (canonical path)

```
Founder Intent
    → Voice Rail          [VERIFIED]
    → Command Control     [VERIFIED]
    → Governed Loop       [PARTIAL — ZONE3 blocks common targets]
        OIL boundary ──► BLOCKED (zone 3)
        PBB plan
        POST /builder/build (kernel wrap)
    → Commit SHA          [PARTIAL — commits possible]
    → DONE Evidence       [BLOCKED / deferred on kernel path]
    → Completion Authority [BLOCKED — deferred, never called from kernel]
    → completion_receipt_id [BLOCKED — not observed in any receipt]
```

Parallel terminal: governed loop outcome verify → `job.status='committed'` **without** completion receipt (split authority).
