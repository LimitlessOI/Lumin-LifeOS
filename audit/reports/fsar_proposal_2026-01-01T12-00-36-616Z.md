idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_6.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
require('dotenv').config();

router.get('/', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        // Business logic to fetch and calculate income snapshots from Stripe API or Neon PostgreSQL database via SQLAlchemy ORM goes here 
        
        res.json({}); // Replace with actual data structure after implementing business logic for snapshot generation
    } catch (err) {
        console.error(err);
        res.status(500).send('An error occurred');
    }}

module.exports = router;

This is for opportunity: AI-Driven Business Consultancy
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
