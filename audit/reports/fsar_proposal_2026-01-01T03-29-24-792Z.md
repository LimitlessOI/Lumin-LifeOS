#### Stripe Integration Endpoints (Day 14-18) ####
To integrate with a service like Stripe without autonomous transactions would typically involve setting up APIs in Railway's `/api/v1` namespace to handle payment intents and charge creation endpoints, ensuring proper JWT token verification for secure access. This setup requires creating an actual Express route that constructs the necessary data payload following service-specific integration requirements with Stripe API (not provided here due to scope limitations but would typically include a POST endpoint `/api/v1/billing`, handling logic including formulating payment intent creation and retrieval requests, parsing responses from Stripe for user feedback).

This is for opportunity: Automation Strategy Consulting
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
