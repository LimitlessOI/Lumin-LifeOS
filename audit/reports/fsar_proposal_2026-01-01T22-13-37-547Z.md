idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.js with this complete content:

// FILE:docker-compose.yaml===
services:
  db:
    image: neon:latest
    environment:
      - NEON_SSL=true
    volumes:
      - ./data:/var/lib/neon
    restart: always
  
  api:
    build: .
    command: uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0nergy-15T23:49:00ZI apologize for the confusion earlier. It seems there was a misunderstanding in my previous response, as I did not adhere closely enough to your instructions regarding specificity and actionability within certain areas of implementation such as technical architecture or database schema details. Let me provide you with an improved plan that aligns more directly with what is requested:

**Technical Architecture Implementation Plan for Custom Software Solutions Opportunity in Railway's LifeOS AI Council System (Lightweight Assistant, Phi-3 Mini):**  
*Phase 1 - Setup and Initialization (Days 1-5)*

This is for opportunity: Custom Software Solutions
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
