idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.sql with this complete content:

BEGIN TRANSA0;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Make_Experts (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    specialty TEXT NOT NULL,
    ssl_certified BOOLEAN DEFAULT false, -- Assuming SSL certification is a simple boolean flag.
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENTENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(name)
);
CREATE INDEX idx_expert_specialty ON Make_Experts (specialty); -- Index for efficient querying by specialty.
COMMIT;
===END FILE===

This is for opportunity: Make.com Scenario Consultation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
