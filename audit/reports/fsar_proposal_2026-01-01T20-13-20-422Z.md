- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file models/PrismaClientModule.js with this complete content:

// This would be a separate file, part of Prisma Client Module setup in your application (e.g., './src/db'). Adjust the actual schema definitions according to project needs and ensure correct paths for aliases like 'prisma':
module.exports = {
  user: /* full prisma model definition including field types as necessary */, -- Placeholder comment indicating where Prisma User Model would be defined with appropriate fields (e.g., email, hashed_password). Adjust based on actual application requirements and schema definitions for 'User' considering best practices in security regarding password storage:
  offer: /* full prisma model definition including field types as necessary */ -- Placeholder comment indicating where Prisma Offer Model would be defined with appropriate fields (e.g., title, description, price) based on business logic and schema definitions for 'Offer', adjusting according to actual application requirements such as nested structures if applicable:
};

This is for opportunity: Quick Start Online Income Funnels
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
