- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/001_create_roi_snapshots.sql with this complete content:

BEGIN;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS roi_snapshots (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    amount DECIMAL(15, 2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.00,
    status VARCHAR(50),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT (NOW() AT TIME ZONE 'utc'),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT (NOW() AT TIME ZONE 'utc')
);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_roi_snapshots_timestamp ON roi_snapshots(timestamp);

COMMIT;

This is for opportunity: Automated Business Process Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
