idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.sql with this complete content:

-- File: migrations/002_create_orders_table.sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS orders (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT REFERENCES customers(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    product_link VARCHAR(255),
    purchase_status ENUM('pending', 'completed', 'cancelled') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENTCTETIER) DOC TO JSONB,
);

This is for opportunity: E-commerce Funnel Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
