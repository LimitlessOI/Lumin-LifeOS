- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_4.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS curated_paths ( -- This table likely holds pre-calculated paths as per the AI curation logic and is essential for real-time path updating based on user profiles 
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    content_ids JSON[] NOT NULL -- Assuming a non-relational field storing an array of IDs to curated learning materials which are relevant for each individual's path as suggested in the original plan document provided by Phi-3 Mini. This design choice aligns with scalability concerns and would facilitate efficient AI curation logic 
);

This is for opportunity: Subscription-Based Learning Platform
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
