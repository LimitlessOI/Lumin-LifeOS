  "proposal": "self_improvement:  To address the issues identified, we need to focus on several key areas to improve our system's performance and reliability. Here are specific, actionable improvements that can be implemented:\n\n1. **Fixing Database Schema Issues:**\n   - The primary issue seems to be with the database schema. The columns related to `ai_model` in the `execution_tasks` table do not exist. This needs to be corrected immediately by adding the missing column(s) or correcting any misconfigurations.\n   - Action: Update the database schema by running a migration script that adds the `ai_model` column if it's missing, ensuring it aligns with existing data types and constraints. Test thoroughly before deploying to production.\n\n2. **Optimizing Code Performance:**\n   - The performance bottlenecks identified are primarily related to implementation durations for different types of tasks (idea implementation, self-improvement). These should be further analyzed to understand the root causes, such as inefficient algorithms, redundant computations, or unoptimized database queries.\n   - Action: Conduct a detailed profiling and benchmarking of these processes using tools like PostgreSQL's query planner and system performance monitoring tools. Based on findings, refactor critical sections of code that are slowing down execution. Consider parallel processing where applicable.\n\n3. **Enhancing ROI Visibility:**\n   - The blind spots detected indicate areas where current tracking or reporting mechanisms do not fully capture the financial impact or operational efficiency. This could be improved by enhancing data collection and aggregation processes.\n   - Action: Implement a more robust system for capturing detailed ROI metrics, including integration with Stripe to better track revenue streams. Develop custom reports that provide deeper insights into performance across different dimensions such as user engagement, task success rates, and financial outcomes.\n\n4. **Reducing Friction in Monetization Flows:**\n   - The recent errors related to task execution failures suggest potential issues in the monetization flow. These could be due to outdated payment methods, insufficient balance alerts, or suboptimal service offerings that deter users from completing tasks.\n   - Action: Review and update the payment gateway settings to ensure they are up-to-date and compatible with current regulations. Implement automated alerts for low account balances to prompt users to top up their accounts promptly. Additionally, continuously evaluate user feedback and adjust services to improve satisfaction and conversion rates.\n\n5. **Ensuring Safety and Ethics:**\n   - While the system has a robust safety framework in place, continuous monitoring and updating of this framework are necessary to adapt to new ethical standards and legal requirements.\n   - Action: Regularly review and update our AI ethics guidelines to align with current best practices and emerging regulations. Implement regular audits and use machine learning models for real-time anomaly detection to ensure compliance and safety protocols are upheld across all operations.\n\nThese improvements should be prioritized based on the criticality of each issue, considering both short-term fixes and long-term strategic enhancements. Testing and deployment should follow a staged approach with thorough validation at each stage to minimize risk and maximize benefits.",
