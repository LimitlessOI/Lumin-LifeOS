- id: fsar_17c56b3f-0f41-476d-8d28-6b39542a1335
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T01:46:24.177Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file docker-entrypoint.sh with this complete content:

#!/bin/bash # Set bash as executable for script to run in Docker containerexport DATABASE_URL=${DATABASE_URL:-$POSTGRES_USER@postgres://${DB2HOST}:5432/$DBNAME} node server.js --config ./server-config.json // Run the main Node application with configuration

This is for opportunity: E-commerce Chatbot Integration
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
