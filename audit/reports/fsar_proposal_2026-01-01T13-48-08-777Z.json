  "proposal": "self_improvement:  To address the issues identified, we need to focus on several key areas including database schema adjustments, improving task execution reliability, optimizing performance metrics, and enhancing blind spot detection mechanisms. Here are some specific, actionable improvements that can be implemented:\n\n### 1. Database Schema Adjustment\nGiven the error about `ai_model` not existing in the `execution_tasks` relation, we need to ensure our database schema is up-to-date and includes all necessary columns. This involves running a migration script to add the missing column if it has been overlooked during previous schema updates.\n\n**Actionable Improvement:**\n- **Database Migration Script**: Develop and deploy a migration script that adds the `ai_model` column to the `execution_tasks` table. Ensure this is backward compatible by adding the column with a default value or NULL, and then update all existing records accordingly if necessary.\n- **Schema Verification**: Implement automated tests to verify database schema integrity post deployment to catch any discrepancies early on.\n\n### 2. Reducing Friction in Monetization Flows\nTo improve monetization flows, we need to ensure that the checkout process is seamless and payment options are user-friendly. This includes:\n\n**Actionable Improvement:**\n- **Streamlined Checkout Process**: Simplify the payment gateway integration, possibly by using a more straightforward API or integrating with Stripe for easier transaction handling.\n- **User Feedback Mechanism**: Introduce a simple feedback system where users can rate their experience after completing transactions to help us continuously improve the service based on user experiences.\n\n### 3. Improving ROI Visibility\nThe performance metrics suggest that there's room for better tracking and visualization of ROI. This involves:\n\n**Actionable Improvement:**\n- **Advanced Analytics Dashboard**: Develop a dashboard using Grafana or similar tools to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) related to ROI, including revenue per user, average transaction value, and profit margins.\n- **Real-Time Data Refresh**: Implement real-time data refresh mechanisms to ensure that the analytics are always up-to-date, which can help in making more informed decisions about future investments and strategies.\n\n### 4. Enhancing Blind Spot Detection\nWith a high number of blind spots detected (9267), it's crucial to refine our systems for better coverage and accuracy:\n\n**Actionable Improvement:**\n- **Sensor Network Optimization**: Expand the network of sensors that monitor user interactions, transactions, and system logs to cover more areas and capture finer details.\n- **Machine Learning Anomaly Detection**: Utilize machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies in data patterns that might indicate blind spots or potential security threats.\n\n### 5. Code and Process Improvements for Reliability\nThe recent task execution failures suggest a need for better error handling and more robust code practices:\n\n**Actionable Improvement:**\n- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Implement try-catch blocks in critical sections of the code to handle exceptions gracefully, potentially retrying failed tasks with exponential backoff.\n- **Code Review Automation**: Integrate static code analysis tools (like SonarQube) into our CI/CD pipeline to catch potential issues before they become big problems and ensure consistent coding standards across the team.\n\nBy addressing these areas through strategic improvements in database management, user experience design, data analytics, and system reliability, we can significantly enhance the performance and resilience of LifeOS AI Council's backend systems.",
