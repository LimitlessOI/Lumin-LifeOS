idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS roi (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    campaign_id INT REFERENCES campaigns(id),
    offer_code VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    revenue DECIMAL(10, 2),
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
