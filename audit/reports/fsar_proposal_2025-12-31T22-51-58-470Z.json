  "proposal": "idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.js with this complete content:\n\n// routes/api.js - Express router for API endpoints using NodeJS with Sequelize ORM integration (Python is not used)\nconst express = require('express');\nconst { DataSource } = require('sequelize'); // Simplified example, assuming you're mixing Python and JavaScript in this system which isn't ideal. Replace 'DataSource' as needed for your actual implementation with Sequelize or another ORM if using NodeJS exclusively.\nconst jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');\n// Additional imports...\n\nconst router = express.Router(); // Assuming an Express Router is used here instead of Railway specifics, adjust accordingly to Python Flask/Django routes as needed for your actual backend choice (e.g., using Django Rest Framework)\nlet sequelize;  // Initially assumed NodeJS environment but can be adapted if necessary with a sequence based initialization in the respective server setup script or function within Railway's infrastructure framework, which is beyond this scope without specific details on how you plan to use Python for database interactions. In Django/Flask, it would typically look like `from sqlalchener import create_engine`\n\n// Initializing Sequelize (simplified example) - Replace with actual sequelize setup and configuration as per your schema definitions:\nconst initializeSequelize = async () => {\n  const config = require('path-to-your-sequelize-config'); // This would be a JSON or YAML file specifying database connection settings.\n  try {\n    await new Promise(resolve => sequelize = Sequelize.initiateWithConfig(config));\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error('Sequelize setup failed:', err);\n    throw err; // Or handle accordingly in a real-world scenario like Railway's own error handling mechanisms or try/catch blocks within the Rails initializer files if using Ruby on Rails backend implementation instead of NodeJS for this example.\n  }\n};\n\n// API endpoint handlers (simplified examples, expand with proper request validations and responses) - Implement input validation as per your application's needs to avoid SQL injection or common mistakes:\nrouter.post('/campaigns', async (req, res) => {\n    // Input validation logic goes here...\n    \n    const campaign = await CampaignModel.create(req.body); // Assuming a Sequelize model called 'CampaignModel' for the sake of example and assuming an API endpoint setup in Express or Django/Flask is required to parse JSON bodies etc. This would be much more complex with actual Python implementation, which was not specified herein due to language constraints but should follow similar principles as above\n    res.status(201).send(campaign);\n});\nrouter.get('/campaigns', async (req, res) => {\n    const campaigns = await CampaignModel.findAll({ where: [] }); // Expand with proper query parameters and conditions/filters as needed for real-world scenarios including pagination if necessary \n    return res.json(campaigns);\n});\n// Additional CRUD endpoints would follow the pattern above...\n\nrouter.post('/user_profiles', async (req, res) => {\n    // Input validation logic goes here...\n    \n    const userProfile = await UserProfileModel.create(req.body); \n    return res.status(201).send(userProfile);\n});\n// Additional CRUD endpoints and authentication would be implemented similarly using appropriate Express or Django/Flask ORM methods, along with JWT tokens for secure access...\n\nmodule.exports = router; // Exporting the Router object to make it accessible as a module in Railway if needed (for illustrative purposes)\n\nThis is for opportunity: AI-Powered Digital Marketing Service\nMake sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.",
