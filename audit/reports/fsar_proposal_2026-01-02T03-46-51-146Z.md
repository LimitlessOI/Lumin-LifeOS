# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_51d05b99-c7fc-463b-86bb-606be71b50bb
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T03:46:51.146Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_4.js with this complete content:

const { validateBusinessModel, createUser } = require('../middlewares/businessModels'); // Assuming validation and user creation are handled here. This file would contain necessary business model handling functions like validating inputs against our schema defined for the financial_records table which include industry sector etc., not included in this example due to complexity limitations 
// ... other function implementations related to business models...

This is for opportunity: Business Model Duplication Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
