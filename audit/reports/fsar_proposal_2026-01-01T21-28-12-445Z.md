# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_3b1b2205-6236-494a-8f88-741df1d2ff9c
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T21:28:12.445Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api/v1/orders.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const { createOrder, getAllOrders } = require('../controllers/orderController'); // Assume these functions are implemented in order controller 
router.post('/', createOrder); // Create a new order associated with the user's payment (omitted here)
router.get('/all', getAllOrders); // Retrieve all orders linked to payments for given period or status, e.g., pending/completed; Include pagination and filtering logic

This is for opportunity: Stripe Integration Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
