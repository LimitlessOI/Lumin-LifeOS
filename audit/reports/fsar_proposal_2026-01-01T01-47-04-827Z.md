self_improvement:  To address the issues highlighted, we should focus on resolving the immediate technical problems with task execution and improving the overall system's performance. Here are some specific, actionable improvements to consider:

1. **Immediate Fixes for Task Execution Issues:**
   - **Database Migration:** Since the error indicates that the `ai_model` column does not exist in the `execution_tasks` table, we need to create a migration script to add this column. This can be done by generating a new migration file and updating the database schema accordingly.
     ```bash
     rails generate migration AddAiModelToExecutionTasks ai_model:string
     rails db:migrate
     ```
   - **Code Review and Testing:** Review the existing codebase to ensure that all tasks have the necessary columns defined. This can help prevent such errors in future executions.
   - **Error Handling and Logging:** Enhance error handling within task execution scripts to provide more detailed logs, which will aid in debugging and preventing similar issues.

2. **Performance Optimization:**
   - **Query Optimization:** Review slow-performing queries or operations that might be causing performance bottlenecks. This can involve indexing strategies for the database or optimizing SQL queries used in tasks.
     ```sql
     CREATE INDEX idx_ai_model ON execution_tasks(ai_model);
     ```
   - **Asynchronous Task Processing:** Implement a more efficient task processing system, possibly leveraging asynchronous job queues like Sidekiq or Celery, to handle tasks without blocking the main application server.

3. **Monetization Flows Improvement:**
   - **Enhanced ROI Tracking:** Integrate with Stripe in a way that not only reads but also logs all financial transactions and activities closely related to income generation. This will provide better visibility into where our money is coming from and how it's being spent.
   - **User Fee Structures:** Review and possibly adjust the fee structures for services offered through the platform, ensuring they are competitive and profitable without alienating users.
   - **Implement Promotions or Discounts:** Introduce promotional offers to incentivize purchases or usage of specific features, which can help in increasing ROI by boosting sales volume without necessarily reducing profit margins.

4. **Ethical Considerations and Safety Measures:**
   - **Data Privacy Compliance:** Ensure that all data handling processes comply with local data protection laws (like GDPR, if applicable). This includes obtaining explicit user consent for data usage, implementing strong encryption where necessary, and regularly auditing the system to ensure compliance.
   - **AI Model Usage Policies:** Define clear guidelines on how AI models should be used in tasks and services. These policies should include specifications around privacy, fairness, transparency, and accountability when deploying machine learning systems.

By addressing these specific improvements, we can not only resolve immediate issues but also enhance the overall robustness and efficiency of our system, ensuring better performance and a more ethical approach to AI usage.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
