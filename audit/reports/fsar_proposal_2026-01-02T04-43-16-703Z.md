idea_implementation: Create or update the file pipeline/Jenkinsfile with this complete content:

pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                // ... commands to build the Docker containers...
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                // ... unit tests for microservices and API endpoints using PyTest/Jest-MatchAnswers or similar tools...
           01b.step {
                    script {
                      sh 'pytest' || '' # example command to run pytests (Python)
                    }
                }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                // ... commands for deployment, including pushing Docker containers and updating Kubernetes pods...
            }
        }
    }

Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
