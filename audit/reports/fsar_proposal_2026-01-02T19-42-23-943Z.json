This ensures relationships are properly maintained between different entities like client needs & their corresponding scenarios without immediate Stripe integration.\n\n2. **API Endpoints** - Implement Express.js routes to handle CRUD operations on the scenario data:\n\nThis is for opportunity: Make.com Automation Scenarios\nMake sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.",
