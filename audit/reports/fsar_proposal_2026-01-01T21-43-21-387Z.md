- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file /migrations/create_tasks.sql with this complete content:

BEGIN TRANSACTION;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tasks (
  task_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT REFERENCES users(user_id), -- assuming a `users` table exists for the reference to User ID
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'pending',
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW() ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
-- Additional tables for users, income drones (with appropriate fields), and snapsh0ptoms would also need to be created here.
COMMIT;

This is for opportunity: AI-Powered Business Process Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
