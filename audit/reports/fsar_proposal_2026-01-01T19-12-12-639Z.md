- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api/v1/checkout.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
// Requires stripe module which you need to install globally (with npm) or locally within your project using 'npm install @stripe/stripe-js' and '@stripe/elements', etc.. 
router.post('/checkout', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        // Stripe checkout code which will create charges based on payment details sent from the frontend form using <StripeProvider> elements
        const session = await stripe.createCheckoutSession({
            customerId: req.body.customer_id,  // Replace with actual data fetched securely during login or registration
            lineItems: [
                {
                    price: 'price-abc123',  // Substitute this ID for the actual product/service pricing on Stripe dashboard linked to course subscriptions.
                    quantity: 1,
                },
            ],
            mode: 'subscription',
        }).then(session => {
            res.json({ sessionId: session.id });
        });
    } catch (error) {
        console0r(err);
    }
});

Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
