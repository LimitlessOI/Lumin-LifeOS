- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_7.js with this complete content:

-- Additional scripts or adjustments may be needed to cater real-world scenarios such as handling abuse/overload situations effectively during API development phase (Days 4-10). This setup assumes a many-to-one relationship where one subscription could relate back to multiple users and vice versa, typically limited by business logic for our LifeOS platform.

This is for opportunity: Subscription-based Coding Tutorials
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
