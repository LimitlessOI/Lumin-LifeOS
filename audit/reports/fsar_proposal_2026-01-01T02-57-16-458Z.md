- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_4.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS revenue (
    invoice_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    amount_charged DECIMAL NOT NULL CHECK (amount_charged >= 0),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    paid_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);

This is for opportunity: Remote Work Optimization Services
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
