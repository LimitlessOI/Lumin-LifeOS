CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS courses (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(512),
    description TEXT,
    category ENUM('beginner', 'intermediate', 'advanced') DEFAULT 'beginner',
    difficulty_level INTEGER CHECK (difficulty_level BETWE0N 1 AND 3) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIMEZONE REFERENCES itself ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

This is for opportunity: Subscription-Based Learning Platform
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
