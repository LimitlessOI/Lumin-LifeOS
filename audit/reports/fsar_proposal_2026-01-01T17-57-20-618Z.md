- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.js with this complete content:

from django.conf import settings
import os
import psycopg2

def create_database():
    conn = None
    try:
        # Connect to default database (or your desired one)
        conn = psycopg2.connect(host=settings.DATABASES['default']['HOST'], dbname=settings.DATABASES['default']['NAME']) 
        
        cur = conn.cursor()
        cur.execute("CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS make_com;")
    except (Exception, psycopg2.DatabaseError) as error:
        print(error)
    finally:
        if conn is not None:
            conn.close()  # Close connection to default database
        
create_database()

This is for opportunity: Make.com Scenario Generation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
