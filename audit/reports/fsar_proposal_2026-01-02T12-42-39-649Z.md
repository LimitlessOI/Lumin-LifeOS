- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.sql with this complete content:

-- Assuming a hypothetical function `executeSQL` that can run raw SQL queries directly from our system (either through the Railway interface or an external script) as part of setup/initialization tasks in light_tasks specialty. Actual implementation depends on how we're connecting to Neon PostgreSQL, which isn’t defined here but assumed for this scenario based on your context plan
BEGIN; -- Start a transaction block to ensure atomicity where all changes are applied or none if there is an error during execution
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL, payment_info JSONB); -- Hypothetical simplified schema for demonstration; actual implementation would likely require more fields and constraints
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS courses (course_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, title TEXT NOT NULL, description TEXT, price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL, difficulty_level VARCHAR(50), ai_content_reference_ids JSONB); -- Hypothetical simplified schema for demonstration; actual implementation would likely require more fields and constraints
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS payments (payment_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, user_id INT REFERENCES users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE, course_id INT REFERENCES courses(course_id), amount DECIMAL(10, 2), transaction_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(), status VARCHAR(50)); -- Hypothetical simplified schema for demonstration; actual implementation would likely require more fields and constraints
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_progress (user_progress_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, user_id INT REFERENCES users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE, course_id INT REFERENCES courses(course_id), progress_percentage INT CHECK(progress_percentage BETWE0N 0 AND 100), completion_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(), badges VARCHAR(255)); -- Hypothetical simplified schema for demonstration; actual implementation would likely require more fields and constraints
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ai_content_references (ai_content_reference_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, content_id INT REFERENCES course_content(course_content_id) ON DELETE CASCADE, relevance_score NUMERIC CHECK(0 <= score AND 1 >= score)); -- Hypothetical simplified schema for demonstration; actual implementation would likely require more fields and constraints
COMMIT; -- Commit the transaction block if all queries are successful or ROLLBACK in case of an error (not explicitly shown here) to ensure atomicity as part of our light_tasks specialty. Actual rollback handling is not defined but assumed for this scenario based on your context plan

This is for opportunity: Online Course Creation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
