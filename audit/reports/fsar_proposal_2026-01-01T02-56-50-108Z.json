  "proposal": "idea_implementation: Create or update the file api_routes.rb with this complete content:\n\n```ruby\n    ROUTES = [\n      get '/webinars', to: 'webinars#index' # List all webinars...\n      \n      post '/webinars/attendees/:id', to: 'attendances#create', as: :new_attendance, constraints: lambda { |request| request.referral_token == params[:event_ref] }\n    ]\n    \n    ROUTES += IntegrationRoutes # Assuming integration routes are defined here...\n    ```\n5. **Frontend Components Design** - Day 16 to 20: Create a user-friendly frontend interface using Rails view templates for creating and managing webinars/events, including forms with validation feedbacks, session timers etc., integrating live streaming video capabilities from services like Zoom or GoToWebinar. Queue as \"Frontend Development.\"\n    ===FILE:views/webinars/_form.html.erb===\n    ```erb\n    <%= form_with model: @webinar, url: webinars_path do |f| %>\n      <div class=\"field\">\n        <%= f.label :event_title %><br>\n        <%= f.text_field :event_title %>\n      </div>\n      \n      # Additional fields and form for live streaming integration...\n    <% end %>\n    ```\n6. **Integration Points Setup** - Day 21 to 23: Integrate real-time revenue tracking with Stripe via optional integration (optional), ensuring proper logging of transactions for analytics purposes, and ensure the Neon PostgreSQL database captures all necessary financial data securely. Queue as \"Stripe & Database Financial Integration.\"\n    ===FILE:stripe_config.rb===\n    ```ruby\n    Stripe::Setup.setup(ENV['STRIPE_SECRET'], Rails.application) do |app|\n      app.customer = { first_name: params[:webinar][:attendee].first_name, email: params[:webinar][:attendee].email }\n      \n      # Additional customer setup for Stripe...\n    end\n    ```\n7. **Testing Strategy Development** - Day 24 to 25: Develop comprehensive testing strategy focusing on automated event workflows, ensuring minimal manual effort in webinar/event management (e.g., Capybara with RSpec). Queue as \"Testing Strategy Development.\"\n    ===FILE:spec/models/webinar_spec.rb===\n    ```ruby\n    require 'rails_helper'\n    \n    RSpec.describe Webinar, type: :model do\n      # Example test for webinar model...\n      \n      it \"is valid\" do\n        expect(Webinar.new).to be_valid\n      end\n\nThis is for opportunity: Webinar and Event Automation\nMake sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.",
