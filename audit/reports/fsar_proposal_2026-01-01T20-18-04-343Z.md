self_improvement:  To address the issues identified, we need to focus on several key areas:

1. **Correcting Database Schema Issues**: The first step is to correct the database schema by ensuring that all necessary columns are present in the `execution_tasks` table. This can be done via a migration script that adds the missing column (`ai_model`) if it was accidentally omitted during setup or migrations.

2. **Optimizing Performance Metrics**: Given the performance bottlenecks, we need to focus on reducing the average duration for each type of task (implement_idea, idea_implementation, self_improvement). This can be achieved by optimizing database queries, improving algorithmic efficiency in code execution, and possibly parallel processing where applicable.

3. **Enhancing Monetization Flows**: To reduce friction and improve ROI visibility, we should consider implementing more robust billing and revenue tracking systems using Stripe integration. This includes setting up automated workflows for invoices, payments, and analytics to track the effectiveness of different monetization strategies.

4. **Ensuring Safety and Ethics**: Given that safety and ethics are paramount in AI operations, it's crucial to implement checks and balances within our system. For instance, we can set thresholds or flags for risky tasks based on predefined ethical guidelines or model performance metrics.

### Specific Improvements:
- **Database Migration**: Create a migration script to add the `ai_model` column to the `execution_tasks` table. This will require updating the database schema and ensuring all existing entries have null values in this new column, as necessary.
  
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE execution_tasks ADD COLUMN ai_model TEXT;
  ```

- **Optimize Query Performance**: Review and optimize SQL queries that are running slowly or consuming excessive resources. Consider using indexes on frequently queried columns, optimizing joins, and reducing the number of operations within a query cycle.

- **Implement Real-time ROI Tracking**: Integrate real-time analytics with Stripe to provide immediate feedback on revenue generated by each service offering. This can include setting up webhooks from Stripe to update our internal metrics in near real-time.

- **AI Model Safety Protocols**: Develop and enforce protocols for regularly auditing AI models to ensure they comply with safety and ethical standards. Implement mechanisms to flag or block deployments of new models that do not meet these criteria until reviewed by a human ethics committee.

By addressing these specific improvements, we can enhance the robustness of our system, improve operational efficiency, and maintain high standards of safety and ethical practices.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
