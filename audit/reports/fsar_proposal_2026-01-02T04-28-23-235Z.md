- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/001_create_tasks.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tasks (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  status VARCHAR(255) CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'in progress', 'completed')),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITHO0UT TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WIT1D OT TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT-3 MINUTE TO NOW() ON UPDATE CURRENT-3 MI5EUTE TO NOW(),
);

This is for opportunity: AI-Powered Task Execution Platform
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
