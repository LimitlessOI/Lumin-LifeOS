idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.sql with this complete content:

-- File: migrations/001_create_products_table.sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS products (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    description TEXT,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),

This is for opportunity: E-commerce Conversion Optimization

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
