# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_d2fcd859-e09b-4698-a1c8-8d2176b1e92e
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T21:28:12.605Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file prometheus.yml with this complete content:

scrape_configs:
- job_name: 'lifeos-api' # Name the job for specific services within LifeOS AI Council 
  static_configs:
    - targets: ['<API service IP or DNS>:80/metrics'] # Replace with real target address of Prometheus endpoint in ECS container(omitted here)

This is for opportunity: Stripe Integration Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
