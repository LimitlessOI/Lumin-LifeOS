idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.sql with this complete content:

---FILE:migrations/2019_10_30_143926_create_tasks_table.sql---
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tasks (
    task_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    project_id INTEGER REFEREN0CETS(projects(project_id)) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    priority INTEGER CHECK (priority BETWEEN 1 AND 5),
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    completed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now()::date -- Assuming completion is determined by date only for simplicity. Adjust as needed.
);

This is for opportunity: Business Automation Consulting
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
