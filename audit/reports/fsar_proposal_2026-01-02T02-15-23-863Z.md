  timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  competitor VARCHAR(255),
  price DECIMAL(10, 2) CHECK (price >= 0),

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
