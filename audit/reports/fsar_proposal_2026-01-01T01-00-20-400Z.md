- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file config/chatbot-service.js with this complete content:

const dotenv = require('dotenv');
dotenv.config(); // Load environment variables from .env file for Stripe and other configurations
// Configuration settings including database connection strings, API keys... 
module.exports = { /* configuration object */ };

This is for opportunity: AI-Powered Customer Support Chatbots
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
