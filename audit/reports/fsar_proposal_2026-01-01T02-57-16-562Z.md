- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_6.sql with this complete content:

import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import * as $ from 'jquery'; // This assumes jQuery is used for simplicity in this example; AngularJS alternatives exist and are recommended 

@Component({
    selector: 'app-task-management',
    templateUrl: './TaskDashboardComponent.html',
})
export class TaskDashboardComponent implements OnInit {
   // Component logic to fetch tasks, statuses etc., using Angular's HttpClient and displaying data in the dashboard goes here 
}

This is for opportunity: Remote Work Optimization Services
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
