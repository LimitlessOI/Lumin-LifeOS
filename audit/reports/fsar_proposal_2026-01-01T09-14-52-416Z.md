- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_4.css with this complete content:

module.exports = {
    up: async (queryInterface, Promise) => Promise.all([
        queryInterface.sequelize.addFields('users', [
            // Add the 'name', 'email_confirmation_token', and any other necessary fields here with appropriate data types as needed for user registration/login flow 
        ]),
        queryInterface.sequelize.addFields('services', [
            { title: DataTypes.STRING, price: DataTypes.DECIMAL(10,2) }, // Ensure you define models and columns with appropriate data types in Sequelize or raw SQL scripts 
        ])
    ]),
    down: async (queryInterface, Promise): Promise => {
        await queryInterface.removeFields('users', [ 'email_confirmation_token' ], true); // Forcefully remove the column for user email confirmations as well if it exists to align with your plan 
        await queryInterface.removeFields('services'); // Remove all records from services table before rollback in case of error or test purpose 
    },
};

This is for opportunity: Self-programming System
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
