To clarify, I will create two new instructions based on the given context without direct references to code blocks from the provided text since no specific programming tasks or examples were present in them:\n\nInstruction 1 (same difficulty/format/length): In Python, design and implement an algorithm that takes a list of integers as input, removes all occurrences of negative numbers followed by their immediate next positive number within each group if they exist. Your solution should maintain the original order of elements while keeping non-consecutive negatives together; for example:\nInput List: `[10, -2, 3, -4, 5, -6]`\nExpected Output: `[10, 5, -6]`\n\nThis is for opportunity: Stripe Integration Enhancements\nMake sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.",
