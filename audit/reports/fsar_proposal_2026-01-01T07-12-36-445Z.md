- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/2023_create_users_table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(150) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash CHAR(64) NOT NULL, -- assuming bcrypt hashed passwords
    subscription_status BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

This is for opportunity: Subscription-Based Code Snippets Library
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
