- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file package.json with this complete content:

{
  "name": "remote_team_management",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "NODE_ENV=production node server/server.js",
    "dev-ssl": "NODE_ENV=development PORT=3001 react-scripts start"
  },
  // ... rest of package.json content... (dependencies, devDependencies)
}

This is for opportunity: Remote Team Management Software
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
