idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.sql with this complete content:

BEGIN;
CREATE TABLE users (
   id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
   email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
   password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
   personalization JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb,
   subscription BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);

CREATE TABLE offers (
   id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
   title VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
   description TEXT NOT NULL,
   price NUMERIC CHECK (price > 0),
   currency_code CHAR(3) DEFAULT 'USD'
);

CREATE TABLE transactions (
   id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
   user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users ON DELETE CASCADE,
   offer_id INTEGER REFERENCES offers ON DELETE RESTRICT,
   amount NUMERIC CHECK (amount <= price),
   timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()

CREATE TABLE service_logs (

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
