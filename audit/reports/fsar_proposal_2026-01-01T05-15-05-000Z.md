- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.css with this complete content:

// models/Product.js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const productSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    price: Number, 
    description: String, // Optional field to describe the item in more detail if needed for Make.com scenarios
    createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now },  
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('Product', productSchema);

This is for opportunity: Custom Make.com Scenarios
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
