actual implementation timelines will be based upon detailed project management plans aligned with these goals and regular performance evaluations during the testing phase using tools like Locust for load simulations to ensure that AI Mini can meet demand efficiently.\n\nThis is for opportunity: AI-Powered Marketing Funnels\nMake sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.",
