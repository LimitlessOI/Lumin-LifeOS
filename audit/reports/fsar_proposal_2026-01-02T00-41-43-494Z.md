- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
const stripe = require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET); // Optional Stripe integration 
// ... other imports as necessary ...

router.post('/api/v1/users', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const newUser = await stripe.customers.create(/* User creation logic with Payment link generation */);
        // Handle user registration or profile updates here...
        return res.status(201).send(newUser);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error creating new user:', error);
        res.status(400).send({ message: 'Unable to create a new user' });
    }}
// Additional routes for CRUD operations on users and content_items...

This is for opportunity: Personalized Learning Systems
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
