- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file db/migrations/2023_12_04_000000_create_users_table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITHOANZOOD TO TIMEZONW FORMAT 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS' NULL on update SET current_timestamp)

This is for opportunity: Game Development for Overlay Distribution
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
