idea_implementation: Create or update the file Dockerfile with this complete content:

FROM node:16.7-alpine as build-stage
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --production && mkdir src
COPY . .
RUN echo 'export DATABASE_URL="postgres://lifeos-neo@localhost:5432/lightweightassistant?sslmode=require&applicationIntent=high"' > .env.local && chmod +x ./docker-entrypoint.sh && mv docker-entrypoint.sh /usr0
RUN npm run build --ifne
COPY dist ./dist

This is for opportunity: E-commerce Chatbot Integration
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
