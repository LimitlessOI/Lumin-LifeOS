idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.css with this complete content:

{
  "database": {
    "connectionString": "DATABASE_URL", // Replace with your actual database URL or connection string here
    "stripeSecretKey": "" // Placeholder for Stripe's secret API key, replace with the obtained value from Quick-Start Inc.'s dashboard.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
