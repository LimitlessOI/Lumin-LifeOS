- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.css with this complete content:

// frontend/components.html - User registration form using Stripe Elements API for collecting payment information securely on the client side before sending it off to server for processing and saving in Neon PostgreSQL database through proper endpoints calls (simplified version) 
<form action="/api/v1/stripe-integration/create_order" method="POST"> <!-- This form submission will trigger a POST request directly into the /initialize endpoint of backend which then handles Stripe initialization. In production, there should be separate endpoints specifically designed for these tasks with proper input validation and authentication checks as per security best practices -->
  <label htmlFor="cardNumber" style={{ color: 'grey' }}>Card Number</label>
  <input id="cardNumber" type="text" required name="card_number"> <!-- Stripe Elements would be used instead of regular input fields in the actual implementation to securely capture card information -->
  
  <button type="submit">Register & Payment Info Submit</button>
</form>

This is for opportunity: Custom Stripe Integration Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
