idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.js with this complete content:

===END FILE===

### API Endpoint for Keyword Analysis (PostgreSQL and Neon) Using Stored Procedure Calling in Express.js Routes - Assumption of an existing stored procedure named `get_relevant_keywords` that returns relevant keywords based on input provided to it, which would need creation elsewhere or be assumed pre-existing

This is for opportunity: AI-Driven SEO Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
