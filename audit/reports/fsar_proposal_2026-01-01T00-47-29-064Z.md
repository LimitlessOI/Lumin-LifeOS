# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_7e0407ff-77cd-41b0-80ba-4eff3a8fc40e
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T00:47:29.064Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_6.js with this complete content:

// Placeholder test files for Express routes and Stripe logging service, actual tests would involve mocked data based on Neon PostgreSQL interactions through Sequelize orm setup separately -- Start of file content --- 
const request = require('supertest'); // Require express to use the supertest library with our app instance (setup not shown here) for E2E testing; replace this line in your actual code by initializing a proper Express instance and configuring it accordingly.
// Tests setup using Mocha/Chai, mock Sequelize ORM interactions where necessary -- End of file content ---

This is for opportunity: Automation Optimization Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
