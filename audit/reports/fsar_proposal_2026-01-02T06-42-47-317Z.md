- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file config/express-server.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express'); // Import the Express package for setting up server configurations and routing definitions here
const app = express(); // Initialize an instance of the Express application object 
app.use(express.json()); // Middleware to parse JSON request bodies before your routes are called; this assumes a RESTful API approach where data is sent in JSON format, which aligns with modern web development best practices for APIs and frontend applications like React or NextJS handling form submissions through HTTP POST requests
app.use(express.static('public')); // Serve static files from the 'public' directory assuming your application has separate directories for templates (HTML/CSS) and client-side JavaScript code bundled with a tool such as Webpack, Parcel, or similar if used in Railway infrastructure setup 
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000; // Use environment variable for the server's listening port to adhere to best practices of keeping sensitive information out of source files and allowing flexibility across different deployment environments (development, staging, production) on Railway as well as other infrastructures
app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`)); // Start the Express server listening for incoming requests here; this is a standard setup pattern in Node/Express applications and aligns with expected behavior of an automated customer support chatbot API system that may be hosted within Railway's robust-magic production environment

This is for opportunity: Automated Customer Support Chatbots
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
