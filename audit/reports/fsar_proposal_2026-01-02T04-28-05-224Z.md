- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file consumers/api_endpoint.py with this complete content:

```python
from kafka import KafkaConsumer
# Assume necessary imports for authentication and SSL are already done here

def consume_messages(topic):
    consumer = KafkaConsumer(
        topic,
        bootstrap_servers=['kafka-broker:9092'],
        group_id='my-group',
        auto_offset_reset='earliest',
        security_protocol='SSL', ssl_cafile='/path/to/ca.pem'
    )
    
    for message in consumer:
        print(f"Received a message: {message.value.decode()}")
```

This is for opportunity: Tech Business Duplication
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
