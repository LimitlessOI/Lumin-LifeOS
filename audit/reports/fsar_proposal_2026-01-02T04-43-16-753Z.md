- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file pipeline/GitLab-CI.yml with this complete content:

stages:
  - build_and_test # referencing the Jenkinsfile deployment stage 'Build' and test stages defined in there...
# Additional pipeline configuration for GitLab CI, including Rails integration if necessary...

This is for opportunity: AI-Powered Business Automation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
