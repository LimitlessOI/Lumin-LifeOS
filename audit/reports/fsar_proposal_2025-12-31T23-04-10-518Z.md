idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_7.js with this complete content:

# File: scripts/revenue_report.py
import json
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import schedule
import time

def generate_revenue_report():
    # Simulated code for generating a revenue report based on parsed Stripe logs and other data sources - actual implementation should use the structured log data from 'parse_stripe_logs' function 
    today = datetime.now().date()
    yesterday = today - timedelta(days=1)
    
    # Assume we have a list of transactions with dates, and an average profit margin percentage to calculate ROI based on revenue from the previous day
    daily_revenue = {'2023-04-01': 500.0} # Example data - actual implementation should use real log data parsed above 
    
    with open('path/to/daily_revenue.json', 'w') as file:
        json.dump(daily_revenue, file)
        
schedule.every().day.at("10:30").do(generate_revenue_report) # Runs the report generation daily at 10:30 AM local time - actual timing can be adjusted based on real-world needs and peak hours for revenue capture

while True:
    schedule.run_pending()
    time.sleep(60) # Checks every minute, could use a more efficient polling mechanism if needed

This is for opportunity: Real-Time Data Analysis Services
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
