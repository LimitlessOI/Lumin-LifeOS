- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.sql with this complete content:

"migrations/001_create_games_table.sql": {
    "===FILE:migrations/001_create_table.sql===",
    "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS games (\\n  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, \\n  title VARCHAR(255), \\n  developer VARCHAR(255), \\n  platform VARCHAR(50), \\n  price DECIMAL);"
}

This is for opportunity: Game Overlay Distribution Platform
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
