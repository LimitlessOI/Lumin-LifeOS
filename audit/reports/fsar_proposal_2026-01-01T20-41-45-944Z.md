idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/002_create_orders_table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS orders (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INTEGER REFERENCES customers(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    total NUMERIC CHECK (total >= 0), -- To ensure no negative order amounts are entered.
    status VARCHAR(50),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT0TIMestamp,
    completed BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE
);

This is for opportunity: Stripe Integration Enhancement
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
