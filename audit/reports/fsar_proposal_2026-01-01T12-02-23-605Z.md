idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.sql with this complete content:

// SQL Migration Script (Express.js route)
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const knex = require('knex')({
  client: 'sqlite3', // Or another database system if applicable, e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL with appropriate connection string settings in development environment  
  migrations: {
    directory: './migrations'
  }
});
// SQL Migration Script (001_create_dentalCementsTable)
knex.migrate.makeExtension('schema'); // Ensure the schema extension is available for complex queries on Knex-powered databases

Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
