- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file config/k8s_ingress.yml with this complete content:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: checkout-service
spec:
  rules:
    - host: yourdomain.com # Replace with actual domain to be used for the frontend application, ensuring it corresponds correctly in DNS records and Railway’ner backend capabilities settings (if applicable).  
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /api/v1/orders  # Define routes within our Express app that should not go through Stripe but directly to the corresponding microservices; replace '/api/v1/orders' with other necessary API endpoints.   
            backend:
              serviceName: checkout-service
              servicePort: 80  # Port and name must match those in your Service definition, ensure this is set correctly for frontend access as per Railway’ner capabilities when not using a cloud provider managed load balancer (i.e., 'clusterIP').  
```

This is for opportunity: Stripe Funnel Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
