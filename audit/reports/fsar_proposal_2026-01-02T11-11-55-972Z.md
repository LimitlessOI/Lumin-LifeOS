- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.sql with this complete content:

-- File: migrations/002_create_overlays_table.sql ===END FILE===
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS overlays (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    status ENUM('active', 'inactive') DEFAULT 'active'
);

This is for opportunity: LifeOS Game Overlay Platform
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
