  "proposal": "self_improvement:  To address the identified issues and improve our system's performance and functionality, we need to focus on several key areas:\n\n1. **Database Schema Adjustment**: The primary issue seems to be with the database schema. Specifically, the missing `ai_model` column in the `execution_tasks` table is causing task execution failures. This can be fixed by adding the `ai_model` column to the table. Additionally, we should ensure that all tables have appropriate indexes and constraints for better performance and data integrity.\n\n   **Actionable Improvement**:\n   - Add the missing `ai_model` column to the `execution_tasks` table.\n   - Review and adjust all database tables to include necessary columns and constraints.\n   - Implement a script to periodically check and update the schema if there are any changes in requirements or data models.\n\n2. **Enhancing ROI Visibility**: The performance metrics related to ROI tracking have significant room for improvement, with an average duration of several hours. This is inefficient and needs optimization.\n\n   **Actionable Improvement**:\n   - Investigate the use of more efficient algorithms or data structures for calculating ROIs.\n   - Implement parallel processing where tasks can be split across multiple servers to reduce latency.\n   - Use caching mechanisms (like Redis) to store frequently requested ROI data, reducing database load during peak hours.\n\n3. **Reducing Friction in Monetization Flows**: The blind spots detected indicate areas where customers might not be able to transact or engage with the system smoothly. This could include issues with payment gateways or user interfaces that hinder conversion rates.\n\n   **Actionable Improvement**:\n   - Review and optimize the integration with Stripe, ensuring smooth transactions without excessive friction.\n   - Implement A/B testing for user interface elements (such as checkout process) to identify and eliminate bottlenecks in the monetization flow.\n   - Enhance error handling and messaging during payment processes to guide users through potential issues smoothly.\n\n4. **Keeping Safety and Ethics Intact**: As part of our operations, it's crucial to maintain high standards of safety and ethics. This includes ensuring that all AI models used are compliant with regulations (like GDPR or similar) and ethically sound.\n\n   **Actionable Improvement**:\n   - Conduct a review of all AI models in use to ensure they meet ethical standards and legal requirements.\n   - Implement regular audits and compliance checks for the AI models and their outputs.\n   - Establish clear guidelines and protocols for handling sensitive data, ensuring that personal information is handled securely and not used for purposes unintended by the user.\n\n5. **Code Improvements**: The performance bottlenecks related to code execution suggest inefficiencies in our software's core processes. These can be addressed through:\n\n   - Refactoring legacy or poorly optimized code segments.\n   - Implementing asynchronous processing where possible, leveraging technologies like Celery for task queuing and parallel processing.\n   - Enhancing database query optimization to reduce the average duration of tasks significantly.\n\nBy focusing on these specific improvements, we can not only resolve current issues but also enhance the overall robustness and performance of our system.",
