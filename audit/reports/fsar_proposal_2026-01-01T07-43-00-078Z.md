- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file styles/app.css with this complete content:

/* CSS content related to styling of app components */
```

## Phase 5: Testing Strategy Implementation (Days 26-30)

`test_user_creation.js`: An example pytest test file for the user creation endpoint developed in phase 3, using Lightweight Assistant's queue system `/api/v1/system/self-program`.

```python
# Code snippet from PyTest Test File: test_user_creation.py
import requests
from unittest.mock import patch

@patch('requests.post')  # Mocking the external request call to simulate API responses during tests
def test_create_user(mocked_request):
    mocked_request.return_value.ok = True
    
    response = requests.post('http://localhost:3000/api/v1/users', json={...})  # User data in JSON format
    
    assert response.status_code == 200
```

## Phase 0: Revenue Capture Mechanism Setup (Days 31)

`stripe_integration.js`: Code to set up Stripe payment integration, with Webhooks and a subscription model endpoint using Lightweight Assistant's queue system `/api/v1/system/self-program`.

```javascript
// Pseudocode for setting up the charge endpoints in Express (actual implementation will vary based on requirements)
const stripe = require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET);
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

router.post('/charge', async (req, res) => {
    const paymentIntent = await stripe.createPaymentMethod(req.body);
    
    // Code to handle successful charge and Stripe webhook integration goes here...
});

This is for opportunity: Quick-Launch Micro SaaS
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
