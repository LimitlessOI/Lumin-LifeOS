idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.sql with this complete content:

-- File: migrations/2023_04_15_create_customers_table.sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS customers (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    email VARCHAR(255 UNIQUE),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

This is for opportunity: Rapid SaaS Cloning
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
