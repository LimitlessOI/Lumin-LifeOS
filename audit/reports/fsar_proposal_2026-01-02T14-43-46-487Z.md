- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_4.js with this complete content:

*Note: This file intentionally leaves out certain configurations that are only needed in development and test environments.*  
**FILE:config/environments/development.rb (for load balancer configuration)*

This is for opportunity: Online Business Enhancement Package
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
