# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_9315fa96-67c9-4d52-a103-96e88e24a4c0

- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.js with this complete content:

===FILE:config/deploymentConfigurations.js===""
const fs = require('fs');
require('dotenv').config(); // Load environment variables from .env file if needed, ensuring sensitive data like API keys are not hardcoded in the codebase.
// Configure deployment with Kubernetes Helm charts or similar infrastructure setup scripts as necessary for CI/CD pipeline integration - this would be beyond a single script and require multiple files including `.gitlab-ci.yml` if using GitLab Pipelines, etc.

This is for opportunity: Game Overlay Distribution Platform
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
