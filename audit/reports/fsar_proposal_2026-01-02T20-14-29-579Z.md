idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.sql with this complete content:

-- FILE: migrations/001_create_make_com_table.sql ===END FILE===
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS make_com (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  client_id INTEGER REFERENCES clients(client_id), -- assuming a 'clients' table exists
  project_details JSONB NOT NULL,
  scenario_plan TEXT DEFAULT '' CHECK ($scenario_plan != '') , -- scenarios stored as text for simplicity in this example. Consider using an object or array structure instead for scalability and maintainability.
  status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'pending'
);

This is for opportunity: AI-Powered Make.com Scenarios
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
