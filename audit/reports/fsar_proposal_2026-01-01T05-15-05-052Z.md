# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_2dc987da-1225-432e-bf5b-5c990d464915

- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_4.js with this complete content:

// server/index.js (main file)
const express = require('express');
const userRoutes = require('./routes/api'); 
const app = new express.Router();
app.use('/api/v1', userRoutes); // Mounting routes for User management at this path in the API namespace within our main server file structure to provide clear separation and organization of functionality under each microservice's scope, following Kubernetes best practices by creating separate deployments or pod templates that are bound together via service abstractions
const port = 3000; // Assuming we want a web interface as well for Make.com scenarios - can be moved to the API route file if necessary (not shown here)
app.listen(port, () => {
    console0.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`); 
});

This is for opportunity: Custom Make.com Scenarios
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
