self_improvement:  To address the issues identified, we need to focus on improving both our backend infrastructure and user experience within the application. Here are some specific, actionable improvements that can be implemented:

### 1. Fixing Database Schema Issues
The primary issue seems to stem from a missing column in the `execution_tasks` table. This has resulted in task execution failures across multiple tasks. Let's rectify this by adding the missing `ai_model` column to the `execution_tasks` table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE execution_tasks ADD COLUMN ai_model VARCHAR(255);
```

This SQL command will add a new column named `ai_model` of type `VARCHAR` with a maximum length of 255 characters. This should resolve the errors related to task execution.

### 2. Optimizing Performance Bottlenecks
The performance bottlenecks are primarily in implementation and self-improvement tasks, which average durations significantly higher than other types. To address this:

- **Implement_idea**: This type of bottleneck might be due to complex or poorly designed ideas. We should introduce a more robust idea evaluation system that includes user feedback loops and real-time analytics to better predict success rates before implementation.
  
  **Actionable Improvement**: Develop an AI model for evaluating the feasibility and potential ROI of new ideas, incorporating user preferences and behavioral data. This will not only reduce the average duration but also improve the quality of implemented ideas.

### 3. Enhancing Monetization Flows
To reduce friction in monetization flows:
- **Implement a User Feedback System**: Collect feedback from users on their experiences with our services, especially related to payment processes. Use this data to identify pain points and implement improvements that enhance user satisfaction without compromising the ethics of collecting unnecessary personal information.
  
  **Actionable Improvement**: Introduce a simple, unobtrusive survey after each transaction or significant interaction within our service. This can be done via in-app notifications or emails with a few carefully chosen questions about their experience and suggestions for improvement.

### 4. Improving ROI Visibility
To enhance the visibility of ROI:
- **Implement Real-Time ROI Tracking**: Integrate real-time data visualization tools to display current and historical ROI metrics directly within the application's dashboard. This will empower users and stakeholders to make informed decisions based on up-to-date financial performance indicators.
  
  **Actionable Improvement**: Develop a dashboard feature that not only tracks total ROI but also breaks down ROI by service or product offering, including graphs and charts for easier interpretation and decision-making support.

### 5. Ensuring Safety and Ethics
To maintain safety and ethical standards:
- **Conduct Regular Ethical Audits**: Review our data handling practices and AI model usage to ensure compliance with strict privacy policies and legal regulations (like GDPR, HIPAA, etc.).
  
  **Actionable Improvement**: Implement an external audit every quarter or when significant changes are made to our data handling processes. This will help identify potential gaps in compliance and allow us to adjust our practices accordingly.

By implementing these improvements across the board—from technical fixes to user experience enhancements—we can significantly reduce errors, improve system performance, enhance user satisfaction, and uphold our safety and ethical standards.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
