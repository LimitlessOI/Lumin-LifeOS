- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.sql with this complete content:

===FILE:routes/api_v1/workflows.js===
const express = require('express');
const { check, validationResult } = require('express-validator');
const router = express.Router();

router.post('/', [check('customer_id').isInt(), 
                   (req, res) => {
    const errors = validationResult(req);
    if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
        return res.status(400).json({ message: 'Invalid customer ID' });
    }
    
    // Insert code to save workflow request in the Neon PostgreSQL database and start a new service flow instance, 
    // possibly with callbacks for when it fails or succeeds based on your actual implementation.
}]);

router.get('/progress/:workflow_id', (req, res) => {
    const workflowId = req.params.workflow_id;
    
    // Insert code to query the database with a prepared statement for efficient data retrieval and return it in JSON format.
});

// Additional API endpoints...

This is for opportunity: Instant Service Workflow Design
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
