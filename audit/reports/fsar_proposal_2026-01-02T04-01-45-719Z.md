idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.sql with this complete content:

// routes/api.js ===START FILE===
const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
const dbConnection = require('../db').connect; // Hypothetical module to handle DB connection (to be implemented)

router.post('/financials', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        await dbConnection(async () => {
            const result = await pool.query`
                INSERT INTO Investments (user_id, funding_amount, date, sector) VALUES (${req.body.userId}, ${req.body.fundingAmount}, NOW(), '${req.body.sector}');
            `;
            
            res.status(201).json({ message: "Investment record created successfully", id: result.recordsets[0][0] });
        });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error creating investment record", error);
        res.status(500).send('An error occurred while creating the investment record');
    }
});
// Additional endpoints for updating and retrieving financial records would go here...

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
