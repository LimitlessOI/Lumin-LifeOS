# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_a9be00b6-5665-47d1-9fae-2a3c054f8576
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T04:30:09.977Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file conf/stripe-webhook.js with this complete content:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET: process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET, // Load from .env file or similar method of secure storage in production environments before ending the configuration block for security purposes as sensitive data like API keys are handled within this section of code throughout application lifecycle
};

This is for opportunity: Stripe Integration Consultancy
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
