- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_5.css with this complete content:

const expressRateLimit = require('express-ratebuster'); // Hypothetical package as a placeholder, actual implementation required based on libraries available at time 
// ... other necessary middleware and code here... 

app.use('/api', rateLimiter({
    max: 100,     // Limit of requests per minute (this is an example value)  
    delayBetweenRequests: 60000 // Time in milliseconds between each request allowed after a previous one has been made. Adjust as necessary for your use case and compliance with PCI DSS standards, ensuring it does not hinder legitimate users significantly while protecting against abuse
}));

This is for opportunity: Stripe + Online Funnel Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
