# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_4c20fc3b-405c-4f0b-9afa-0a551d22d019
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T20:13:04.957Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file config/database_secrets.env with this complete content:

DATABASE_URL="neon://localhost" # This should be replaced with actual Neon PostgreSQL credentials in a production environment

This is for opportunity: Make.com Automation Scenarios
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
