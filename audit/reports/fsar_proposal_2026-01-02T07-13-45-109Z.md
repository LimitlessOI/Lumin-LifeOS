- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file views/submit_code.html with this complete content:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Submit Code</title>
    <!-- Add necessary meta tags for proper rendering -->
</head>
<body>
    <form action="/submit" method="post">
        <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Username..." required>  
        <textarea name="code_snippet"></textarea>  # Assuming we store full code submissions as text for simplicity here. Can be changed based on Railway's robust infrastructure needs and size constraints    
        <!-- Additional fields like problem statement, etc., go here -->
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>  
    </form>
<!-- Frontend JavaScript would handle form submission via AJAX using Fetch API or XMLHttpRequest to the `/submit` route which will interact with RabbitMQ and Kafka Consumer services directly in Railway's robust infrastructure system itself, handling queues setup as required for light_tasks management capabilities -->  
</body> end of body content here

This is for opportunity: Custom Code Review Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
