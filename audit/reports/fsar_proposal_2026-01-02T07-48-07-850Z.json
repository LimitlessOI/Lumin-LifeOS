  "proposal": "self_improvement:  To address the issues identified, we need to focus on several key areas with specific actions:\n\n1. **Resolving Database Schema Issues**: The current errors indicate a schema mismatch or migration issue. We should immediately investigate and correct this by ensuring that the database schema is up-to-date and compatible with the application code. Specifically, we need to add the missing `ai_model` column in the `execution_tasks` table.\n   - **Action**: Perform a database migration script to add the `ai_model` column. Verify this by checking the current state of the database schema against the expected model and apply necessary changes using Django's orm migrations if applicable, or directly execute SQL commands if not.\n\n2. **Optimizing Performance Bottlenecks**: The performance metrics suggest that some tasks are taking unusually long to complete, potentially impacting user experience. We need to identify which specific tasks these are and focus on optimizing them. Given the type of task (e.g., code generation), optimization might involve improving algorithms or increasing computational resources allocated to the system.\n   - **Action**: Profile the current execution times for each task type and pinpoint the bottlenecks. Investigate if there's a way to parallelize tasks, optimize database queries, or upgrade hardware configurations. Consider implementing caching mechanisms where appropriate to reduce response times for frequently requested tasks.\n\n3. **Enhancing Safety and Ethics**: Given the focus on safety and ethics, we need to ensure that all AI models used in task execution are ethically sourced and aligned with our community guidelines. This includes regular audits of model outputs and user interactions to detect any biases or unsafe behaviors.\n   - **Action**: Implement a routine check for ethical compliance at each stage of the data processing pipeline and after deployment, including setting up feedback loops where users can report concerns. Consider integrating AI ethics assessment tools into our development workflow to flag potential issues early on.\n\n4. **Improving Monetization Flows**: The blind spots detected suggest that there might be areas in our monetization strategy not fully exploited or opportunities for refining the user journey towards conversion. We should analyze these blind spots and implement strategies such as targeted marketing, personalized offers, or optimizing the checkout process to enhance ROI from existing customers.\n   - **Action**: Conduct a detailed analysis of user behavior data (e.g., through analytics tools) to identify patterns that indicate potential improvement areas in the monetization flow. Implement A/B testing for small changes in the user interface or messaging to gauge their impact on conversion rates.\n\n5. **Enhancing ROI Visibility**: The lack of visibility into ROI metrics might be affecting decision-making processes. We need to implement robust tracking mechanisms and reporting tools that provide clear, actionable insights into the financial performance of our monetization strategies.\n   - **Action**: Set up a detailed dashboard for key ROI indicators such as revenue per user, lifetime value, and monthly recurring revenue (MRR). Integrate this with external data sources if necessary to improve accuracy. Automate reporting processes where possible to reduce manual overhead.\n\nBy focusing on these specific actions, we can address the immediate concerns while laying a foundation for long-term improvements in system performance and user experience.",
