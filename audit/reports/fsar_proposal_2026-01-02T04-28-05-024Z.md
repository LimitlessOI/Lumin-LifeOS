- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
// Assume necessary imports for async handling, database connection are already done here
router.get('/queue', async (req, res) => {
    // Implement queuing logic and return tasks to the client if needed
});

router.post('/self-program', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const suggestions = await generateServiceWorkflowSuggestions();
        res.json(suggestions);
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).send('An error occurred');
   01: API Endpoint for queueing tasks in our execution system using Kafka as the message broker and Node.js to interact with it might look like this:

===FILE:routes/queue-api.js===
```javascript
const kafka = require('kafkajs');
const { Consumer, Producer } = require('kafkajs');
// Assume necessary imports for database interaction and business logic are already done here

const app = express();
app.get('/queue', async (req, res) => {
    const consumer = new kafka.Consumer(process.env.KAFKA_CONFIG);
    
    await client.connect();
  
    try {
        for await (const message of consumer.consume({ topic: 'tasks-queue' })) {
            console.log(`Received a task with key ${message.key}`);
            
            // Here you would interact with your business logic layer to process the tasks and save them in Neon PostgreSQL database if needed
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    } finally {
        await client.close();
    }
  
    res.send('Tasks are being processed asynchronously');
});
```

This is for opportunity: Tech Business Duplication
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
