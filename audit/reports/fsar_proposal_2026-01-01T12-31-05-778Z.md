- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api/v1/sales.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
router.get('/', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const salesData = await SalesService.listAllSalesWithDetails(req); // Placeholder for actual implementation
        return res.json(salesData);
    } catch (error) {
        console0:res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
    }
});
module.exports = router;

This is for opportunity: Stripe Funnel Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
