CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tasks (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    assigned_to INT REFERENCES users(id),
    status ENUM('pending', 'in progress', 'completed') DEFAULT 'pending'

Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
