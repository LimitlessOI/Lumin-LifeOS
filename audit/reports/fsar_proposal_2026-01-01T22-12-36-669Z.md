# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_308f6b05-4b6d-4a4b-8db7-e494ce0abc57
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T22:12:36.669Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file dashboard/revenue-metrics.yml with this complete content:

api_endpoint: "http://localhost:5000/v1/system/self-program" // Assuming this route provides necessary metrics for monitoring dashboards in Grafana... 
// ... complete content with details on how the data is formatted and periodically fetched from our system endpoints. ...

This is for opportunity: AI-Driven Income Drones
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
