// File: models/user.js ===START FILE===
const User = mongoose.model('User', new mongoose.Schema({
    email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
    role: { type: String, enum: ['student', 'teacher'], default: 'student' }

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
