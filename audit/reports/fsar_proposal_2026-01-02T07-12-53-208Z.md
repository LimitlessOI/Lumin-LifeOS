===END FILE===

### `config/database.js` (Assuming we're using Sequelize as an ORM)
This file contains the connection string to our Neon PostgreSQL database which will be used in conjunction with Laravel Eloquent or a similar tool for seamless CRUD operations against it within backend services:

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
