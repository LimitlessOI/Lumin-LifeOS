Also consider adding a middleware for authentication based on user tokens if needed in real scenario:\n// router.use(authenticateTokenMiddleware); // This is pseudocode; implement actual token validation logic using libraries like jsonwebtoken with Sequelize-typescript (Sequelize ORM type definitions). \n\nmodule.exports = router;\n\nThis is for opportunity: Automated Customer Support Solutions\nMake sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.",
