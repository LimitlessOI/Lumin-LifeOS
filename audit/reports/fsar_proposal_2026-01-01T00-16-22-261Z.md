**Testing Strategy:**
   - Implement test suites using a combination of unit tests for individual components and integration testing to ensure seamless interaction between different parts like the Shopify API, Neon PostgreSQL database backend, frontend React application with Redux state management. Employ e2e (End-to-End) testing tools such as Cucumber or Cypress alongside Selenium for UI interactions and employ mock servers using Railway's self-programming endpoint to simulate different scenarios including inventory changes, payment processing failures, etc., ensuring thorough test coverage before deployment.
   
**Deployment Steps:**
   - Deploy the Neon PostgreSQL database with Docker containers or Kubernetes clusters managed via Railway for scalability and high availability concerns using Rolling deployments to minimize downtime during updates. Setup CI/CD pipelines on Railway utilizing GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins integrations that trigger builds upon code pushes into the repository with appropriate automated tests passing before deployment steps are executed which includes container orchestration if necessary for multi-tiered services and microservices setup within our architecture.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
