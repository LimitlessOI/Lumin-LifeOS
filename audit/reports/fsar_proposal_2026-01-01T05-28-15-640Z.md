# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_0b21cb16-1f95-46a8-b2fb-76055d184c52
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T05:28:15.640Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.js with this complete content:

// models/db.js (Sequelize)
const { dbConfig } = require('../config'); // Contains DB connections settings for neonPostgresDB
module.exports = sequelize => {
    const Customer = sequelize.define('Customer', { /* columns definitions */ });
    return { Customer, Sequelize };
};

This is for opportunity: Make.com Scenario Design
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
