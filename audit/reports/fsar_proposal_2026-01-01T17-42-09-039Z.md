```properties
DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:$NEON_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/lifeos_db?sslmode=require&applicationName=LifeOS-AI%20Council # Replace 'username' and add your actual password, ensure ssl mode for secure communication with Neon PostgreSQL database

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
