# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_ed8ffa9c-1dcd-462e-8663-b58a1c47a586
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T11:12:36.757Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file config.js with this complete content:

import { createMuiTheme } from '@material-ui/core/styles';

const theme = createMuiTheme();
export default theme;

This is for opportunity: Game Overlay Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
