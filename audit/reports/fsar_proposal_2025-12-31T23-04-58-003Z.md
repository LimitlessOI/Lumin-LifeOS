idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api_v1/getRevenueGrowthReport.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
router.get('/', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Assume `retrieveSEORevenue` is a function that calculates and returns the monthly revenue growth report based on SEO tasks completed by clients using AI-optimized websites; in production environment this would interact with Stripe's API for handling payments, aggregating them into respective client accounts. For mock purposes: fixed sampled responses are returned directly here to simulate successful retrieval of a revenue growth report due as per plan provided by Phi-3 Mini (Local).
    const seoRevenueReport = { // Mocked data representing monthly SEO task completion and related income; in production, these would be dynamic based on Stripe's payment processing logic. 
      totalIncome: '500', // This value here is a placeholder for the actual revenue generated from successful subscriptions after using our service (mocked). The real implementation will fetch this data asynchronously via an API call to stripe or similar services which are not implemented in demo code snippet provided.
      monthlyTargets: { 2019-10: '450', // Target revenue for the current year's October (mocked). In a real environment, this would be fetched based on tier pricing models or other business logic considerations which are not implemented here due to scope limitations.
    };
    
    res.json(seoRevenueReport);
  } catch (error) {
    console cout_file("Error retrieving revenue growth report: ", error.message); // This function logs the message and an associated error code; assumedly, Railway's internal logging mechanisms would replace this in production environment with more sophisticated monitoring tools like ELK stack or Splunk for real-time insights into application performance (mocked here).
    res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error'); // In a full implementation, different status codes and messages would be used to communicate specific errors back to the client which are not covered in this mock snippet as per scope limitations provided by Phi-3 Mini (Local). 
  }
});
module.exports = router;

This is for opportunity: AI-Powered SEO Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
