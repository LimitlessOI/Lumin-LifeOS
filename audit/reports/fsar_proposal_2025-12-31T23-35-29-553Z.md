- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/2023_create_customers_table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS customers (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(150) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    phone NUMERIC CHECK (phone >= 100 and phone <= 99999),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

This is for opportunity: AI-Driven Service Workflows
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
