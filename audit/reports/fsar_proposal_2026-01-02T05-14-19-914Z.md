# FSAR Proposal Report

- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.sql with this complete content:

-- Create the products table if it does not exist:
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS yourSchema.products (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, -- Adjust data types and constraints as needed for each field based on requirements; replace `id` accordingly to reflect actual schema naming conventions or primary keys used in PostgreSQL/Sequelize setup
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  price DECIMAL(10, 2), -- Adjust precision as needed for your use case: Decimal with two decimal places is standard for money values.
  inventory_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0 CHECK (inventory_count >= 0) NOT NULL, // Ensure positive integer stock levels; replace `yourSchema` and field names accordingly to reflect actual schema details.
  createdAt TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP -- This adds a timestamp with time zone for record creation: Adjust based on your database's timezone settings or remove if UTC is standard across the platforms you are targeting. Replace `createdAt` field name as needed to match schema conventions, such as using snake_case 'created_at'.
  // Additional fields like categoryId (FK) and more would be here...
);

This is for opportunity: E-commerce Platform Duplication
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
