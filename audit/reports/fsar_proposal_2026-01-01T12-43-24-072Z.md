- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_4.js with this complete content:

// file: routes/api.js
const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
const Stripe = require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET); // Ensure to set up your .env with the correct secret key for stripe integration

router.get('/api/v1/system/customer-insights', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const customerInsights = await Stripe().customers.list('IN_CUSTOMER_ID'); // IN_CUSTOMER_ID should be replaced with the actual ID after authenticating via OAuth token in request headers or query params as necessary for security
    res.json(customerInsights);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send('Error fetching customer insights');
 0xFF, 'A', 0x7F]; // Example character ranges to check in the font file using libfreetype2
}

This is for opportunity: AI-Driven Customer Insights Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
