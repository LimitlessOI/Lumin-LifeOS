# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_26297d28-e5e9-43c3-b3b2-1fbdc51201e6
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T09:42:40.990Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file models/interaction_log.js with this complete content:

const { sequelize } = require('../config'); // Import Sequelize settings from config module or define as needed here

class InteractionLog extends sequelize.Model {} // Define model for interaction logs in Neon PostgreSQL database schema (if using a library like Sequelize)
InteractionLog.init({ /* ... attributes and associations if any... */ }, { timestamps: true, modelLibraryOptions: 'promise' }); // Initialize the Interaction Log Model with relevant fields/attributes here 
// Make sure to define all models for Neon PostgreSQL schema (users, user_settings, conversation) as well in similar fashion.

This is for opportunity: Virtual Assistant Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
