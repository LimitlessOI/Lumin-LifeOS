# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_9f5b3b04-4c1f-4423-8440-9155166fcb78
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T07:13:45.007Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express'); // Assuming Node environment to develop the backend service, with self-programming capabilities via light_tasks setup for Railway's backbone infrastructure system itself directly in our robust AI Council 
const router = express.Router();  
// ... complete file content including route handlers that handle submissions and code reviews...

This is for opportunity: Custom Code Review Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
