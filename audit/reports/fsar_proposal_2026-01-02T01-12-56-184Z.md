idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_4.sql with this complete content:

---FILE:migrations/2019_10_30_144058_create_automation_solutions_table.sql---
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS automation_solutions (
    solution_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    complexity INTEGER CHECK (complexity BETWEEN 1 AND 3), -- Assuming a scale for simplicity. Adjust as needed.
    cost_estimate NUMERIC(10,2) CHECK (cost_estimate > 0)
);

This is for opportunity: Business Automation Consulting
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
