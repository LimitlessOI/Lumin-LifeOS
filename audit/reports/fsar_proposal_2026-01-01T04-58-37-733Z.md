- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.sql with this complete content:

-- Create customers table to store customer data with necessary fields including email for Stripe integration and secure password handling in the system logic not captured here as they are beyond SQL scope but can be set up using Rails Sequel or ActiveRecord where applicable (not included due to instruction constraints).
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.customers (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,  -- Unique identifier for each customer record
    name VARCHAR(100),       -- Customer's full name
    email VARCHAR(254) UNIQUE,   -- Email address used in Stripe webhook integration and communication with Phi-3 Mini. Assume validation is handled by Rails/Sequel or ActiveRecord for secure handling of passwords (not included).
);

-- Create orders table to track customer purchases linked to their respective customers' ID through a foreign key constraint on the custom_id field matching the primary key id from the customers table, assuming that this will link with an inventory system which is also not detailed in scope. This assumes Rails/Sequel or ActiveRecord for ORM-related operations (not included).
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.orders (
    order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,                  -- Unique identifier for each order record within the queue management context of Phi-3 Mini's task system.
    customer_id INTEGER REFERENCES public.customers(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,   -- Ensure referential integrity with customers table and use Rails/Sequel or ActiveRecord for proper foreign key relationships handling (not included).
    order_details JSONB NOT NULL,                  -- Order details stored in a flexible format allowing both structured data like items purchased plus additional context. Details about ROI tracking would also be added here through custom logic not represented by this code snippet and should include an analysis endpoint when needed as part of the backend integration with Phi-3 Mini (not included).
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,               -- Automatic timestamp for order creation. 
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENTносиплей
);

This is for opportunity: Automation Workflow Design
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
