- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_5.js with this complete content:

def fetch_spend_data():
    response = requests.get('https://example.com/finance/spend_data') # Replace 'https' with the actual HTTP scheme if needed
    spend_df = pd.read_csv(pd.compat.StringIO(response.text))  # assuming CSV format for simplicity here, though a real scenario might involve additional data processing steps or use of Pandas read from file operations on Azure Blob Storage directly as per the system's architecture and requirements
    return spend_df

This is for opportunity: E-commerce Funnel Enhancement
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
