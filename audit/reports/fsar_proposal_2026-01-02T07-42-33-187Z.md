- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.js with this complete content:

// File: api/routes/index.js
const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
require('dotenv').config();

router.post('/users/login', loginController); // Assuming JWT token generation logic is in the controller `loginController`
router.post('/reviews/new-request', reviewRequestController, upload: ['code']]); 
// More routes as needed for other functionalities like submitting code snippets or diffs...
module.exports = router;

This is for opportunity: Rapid Code Review Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
