- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.sql with this complete content:

-- Create users table (assumed migration filename: `2019_04_07_000000_create_users_table.sql` for YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Users(
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, 
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL, 
    password TEXT NOT NULL
);

This is for opportunity: Remote Work Optimization Services
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
