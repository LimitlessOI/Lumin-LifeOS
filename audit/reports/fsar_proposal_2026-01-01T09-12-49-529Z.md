idea_implementation: Create or update the file start/server.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
require('dotenv').config(); // for environment variables like DB credentials
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
// Load routes and initialize database connection...
module.exports = app;

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
