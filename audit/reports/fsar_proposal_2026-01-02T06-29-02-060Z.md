Generate SQL migrations based on models. Run them with `sequelize db:migrate` command in your terminal, ensuring to drop previous tables before running it if needed. The below script should give you an idea of how this could look like using Sequelize CLI and TypeORM for the database schema (notice that some fields were replaced by `#PRIMARY KEY(PRIMARY)` as a placeholder):

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
