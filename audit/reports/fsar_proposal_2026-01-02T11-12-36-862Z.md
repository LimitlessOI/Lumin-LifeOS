# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_fec2abc7-d77f-4f2c-93f7-b969a5d6889d
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T11:12:36.862Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file stripeConfig.js with this complete content:

// Set your secret key in environment variables, not embedded directly into code for security reasons
import { loadStripe } from '@stripe/stripe-js';
const stripe = await loadStripe('your_secret_key'); // replace 'your_secret_key' with the actual Stripe secret key provided by your dashboard or API keys. Never hardcode secrets into codebase for security reasons, use environment variables instead.

This is for opportunity: Game Overlay Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
