- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS task_assignments (
    assignment_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_id INT REFERENCES employees(employee_id),
    task_description TEXT NOT NULL,
    due_date DATE NOT NULL,
    status ENUM('pending', 'in progress', 'completed') DEFAULT 'pending'
);

This is for opportunity: Remote Work Optimization Services
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
