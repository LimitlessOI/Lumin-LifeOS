- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_4.js with this complete content:

module.exports = router;
===END FILE===### Frontend Components (`Dashboard`) ###
**Note: This is a high-level structure of what the frontend could look like for dashboard functionality, actual implementation would require detailed design and code writing based on specific user experience requirements (UI components not fully developed here). --- React Component Structure - Start of file content --

This is for opportunity: Automation Optimization Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
