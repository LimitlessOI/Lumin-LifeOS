Consider the following modifications: \n1. Incorporate an OAuth authentication flow within your light_tasks endpoints and explain how it adds security when dealing with sensitive user data in both frontend interactions and backend processes on Railway.\n2. Extend your system's capabilities to handle refund requests, which must be processed through a Python script that interfaces directly with Stripe API for real-time reconcine processing of funds – ensuring customer satisfaction while maintaining revenue capture integrity within the robust AI Council system framework as detailed in the original plan.\n3. Develop and integrate an anomaly detection mechanism into your light_tasks tasks, using machine learning algorithms to analyze conversion data patterns that could indicate fraudulent activities or major performance issues – this will be crucial for proactive maintenance of customer experience standards within our robust AI Council system framework on Railway: \n   - \"Anomaly Detection System\" code and implementation strategy. \n4. Create a microservices-based structure where each component (backend processing servers, React frontend dashboard) operates as an independent service that can scale horizontally – discussing scaling strategies within the context of Railway's robust architecture for Digital Marketing Funnels: \n   - \"Microservice Architecture Design and Scalability Strategy\" code. Provide a thorough explanation along with your response, ensuring you include all necessary details to fulfill these complex modifications while following the format requirements detailed in Instruction 1 above. ### Opportunity & Objective Summary: Revenue Potential $7500.00 - First Quarter of Launch\n- Market Demand for Personalized Digital Experiences Aligns with Competitive Edge, Aiming to Capture and Optimize Conversions through a Robust System Utilizing Light_tasks Processing Capabilities within 40 Days Using Minimal Resources:  \n    - Marketing strategists will guide funnel design based on sophisticated data analysis.\n- Sales tools for tracking revenue, ROI snapshots, and blind spots in the customer journey that we aim to address with targeted interventions through our light_tasks system queueing capabilities are essential components of this plan:  \n    - The robust architecture will ensure seamless data flow across backend processing servers handling incoming tasks from light_tasks endpoints. These processes manage database queries for real-time analytics using Neon PostgreSQL and oversee Stripe integration with optional enabling, providing secure transaction logging within the system's self-programming capabilities:\n    - The frontend interface will provide user access to funnel metrics through React components built on Railway. This ensures a responsive dashboard that enhances marketing strategists’ abilities in content creation and decision making based on AI recommendations for offer previews, conversion stats visualization with interactive elements like charts and graphs:  \n    - Stripe Integration (if enabled) will streamline transactions by embedding necessary form fields directly into our frontend design. This supports a user-friendly checkout experience without disrupting workflow while simultaneously capturing revenue data points essential for performance analysis, all within the secure boundaries of light_tasks validated checks and subsequent logging in Neon PostgreSQL:\n    - A seamless flow from customer entry through conversion is facilitated by robust API endpoints that integrate with Rails backend processing servers as well as third-party tools like Stripe. These include creating new offers, retrieving user interaction logs for targeted personalization strategies and content creation (POST /api/v1/offers), integrating payment processes through light_tasks validated checks to ensure secure transactions while enhancing the customer experience with seamless payments directly integrated within our AI framework's self-programming capabilities:\n    - Integration points between system components are crucial for ensuring smooth operation of our Digital Marketing Funnel. This includes direct integration and data exchange through light_tasks endpoints, setting up environment variables securely with Railway’s CLI tools (for API keys), configuring Rails' stripe webhooks alongside Neon PostgreSQL schema deployments to ensure a seamless transaction flow:\n    - The revenue capture mechanism via Stripe integration will be set through the necessary setup for payment processing using light_tasks validated checks, allowing secure transactions while capturing essential data points directly into our robust AI Council system framework's Neon PostgreSQL database schema to ensure a smooth and efficient process:\n    - Testing phase includes load testing via JMeter or Gatling tools alongside unit tests with RSpec for backend processing servers. Monitoring the performance bottlenecks through light_tasks task queue analysis will be critical in ensuring optimal response times, secure transactions, and seamless data flow:\n    - Configuration files like `config/database.js` ensure environment variables are correctly set up to handle credentials safely for both Rails's database interactions with Neon PostgreSQL as well as Stripe API integration when payment processing is enabled in the system framework; ensuring smooth operation and security within our robust AI Council production setup:\n    - We will execute all these components through thorough coding, detailed SQL migrations, complete Express.js routes for efficient handling of requests/responses between endpoints (API), React dashboard elements to ensure an engaging UI experience with interactive data presentation (components written in JSX or HTML combined with CSS styling and managed by NextJS).\n- Revenue Capture Mechanism: Stripe Integration through secure API setup for payment processing, coupled with real-time analysis of ROI snapshops via light_tasks to continuously optimize offer designs. It is essential that this system allows personalized experiences based on conversion data while ensuring a seamless integration between backend and frontend components:  \n    - As the new enhancements are introduced, we will also integrate an OAuth authentication flow within our light_tasks endpoints to secure user information further (if necessary for Stripe integrations), ensure customer satisfaction by processing refund requests using a Python script that interfaces with Stripe API directly and analyze conversion data patterns in real-time. This integration of anomaly detection mechanisms, through machine learning algorithms within our light_tasks tasks will help us identify any fraudulent activities or major performance issues proactively:\n    - Developing the system into a microservices architecture where each service operates independently yet cohesively with Rails backend servers and React frontend ensures scalability. This structure promotes an efficient, robust Digital Marketing Funnel capable of handling high traffic volumes while maintaining optimal response times as per Railway's capabilities:\n    - The development plan includes a thorough explanation along with necessary code for each component to ensure all modifications are meticulously integrated into the current system framework outlined in Instruction 1. This will include complete and detailed Express.js routes, Python scripts interfacing Stripe API directly from backend processing servers where appropriate:\n    - The implementation of a comprehensive testing strategy using JMeter or Gatling for load tests to ensure performance benchmarks are met; alongside unit tests with RSpec framework used in the Rails setup will be updated and expanded upon. \n- Revenue Capture Mechanism through Stripe Integration: Python scripting that interfaces directly within our system, ensuring transaction security via light_tasks validated checks for secure payments while also capturing critical revenue data points needed for performance analysis (if enabled). This mechanism will be fully integrated and operational in Railway environment to maintain a seamless checkout experience.\n- Revenue Capture Mechanism - Monitoring & Optimization: Real-time ROI snapshots through light_tasks analytics, providing market demand insights for strategic planning while ensuring that all data is securely managed and stored within the Neon PostgreSQL schema to maintain high customer experience standards.\n\nThis is for opportunity: Digital Marketing Funnels\nMake sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.",
