- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/001_create_table.sql with this complete content:

BEGIN TRANSA0; -- Begin a transaction for atomicity
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS overlay_games (
    overlayId UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    gameTitle VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    developerName VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
-- Table creation ends here with commit after all migrations are done to ensure atomicity.
COMMIT; -- End the transaction by committing changes made during this session.

This is for opportunity: Game Overlay Distribution Platform
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
