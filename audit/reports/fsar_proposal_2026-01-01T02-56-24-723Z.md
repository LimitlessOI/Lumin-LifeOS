- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
// ... other necessary imports, middleware setup...

router.post('/create_artwork', lifeosaiHandler.handleCreateArtwork); // Assuming `lifeosaiHandler` is a module handling the art creation logic with database interactions.
router.get('/artworks/:id/', lifeosaiHandler.getArtworkById, lifeosaiHandler.authenticateUserBeforeAccessToArt); -- OWNERTO: The handler needs to be implemented as per project requirements and access control policies. Replace 'lifeosaiHandler' with the actual module name when integrating it into your codebase after creating or modifying handlers in `create_artwork` etc., endpoints, which are not provided here due to missing specific details from instructions on how they should function exactly within this context but assumed as part of a complete system.
router.get('/users/', lifeosaiHandler.listUserProfiles); -- OWNERTO: Similar replacement and handler implementation for user profile list retrieval is expected, not provided here due to missing specific details from instructions on how they should function exactly within this context but assumed as part of a complete system.
router.get('/payment_gateway/', lifeosaiHandler.handlePaymentGateway); -- OWNERTO: Handler for Stripe payment integration, which is not provided here due to missing specific details from instructions on how they should function exactly within this context but assumed as part of a complete system and needs implementation based on the project requirements after integrating with Stripe API.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
