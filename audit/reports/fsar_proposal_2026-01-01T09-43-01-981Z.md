- timestamp: 2026-01-01T09:43:01.981Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_7.js with this complete content:

#### /api/v1/take_snapshot ####
`server.js`: (Snapshot capability API endpoint for capturing current state of the transactions table as per system requirements)

This is for opportunity: Automated Invoice Processing
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
