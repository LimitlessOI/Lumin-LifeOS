- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file Docker/Lightweight_Assistant/Dockerfile with this complete content:

FROM node:latest as build-stage
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --production
COPY . .
RUN npm run build # Assuming we have a script to bundle our frontend assets.

This is for opportunity: Custom Code Review Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
