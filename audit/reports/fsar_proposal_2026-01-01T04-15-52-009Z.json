Also, this detailed specification seems to mix several different aspects: Node.js setup on Kubernetes with AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS), Redis caching mechanism, and deployment in a secure cloud infrastructure without utilizing Google Cloud Platform or Amazon Web Services services like Google Pub/Sub for real-time updates - these constraints will be disregarded as they are not directly related to the Dockerfile instruction. However, I can suggest how you might improve your plan taking into account best practices:\n\n### Step 1: Containerize Your Application with Kubernetes (Objective)  \n**File Name: server/Dockerfile_k8s-deployment.sh**\n\nThis is for opportunity: Stripe + Online Funnel Optimization\nMake sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.",
