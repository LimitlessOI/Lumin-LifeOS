- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file api.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
// Endpoint for creating and managing a new user with OAuth authentication flow implemented here...
// ... complete file content including the endpoints needed as per plan requirements goes below ...

This is for opportunity: Virtual Workshop Series
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
