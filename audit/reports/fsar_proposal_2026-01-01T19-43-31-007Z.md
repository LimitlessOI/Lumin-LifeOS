# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_c34da307-4bb7-4d45-8f7f-a8e95fc59b50
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T19:43:31.007Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_8.js with this complete content:

#### Configuration Files #### (For Kubernetes orchestration)
`k8s/deployment.yaml`: (Application deployment configuration with Helm or similar tools setup by Lightweight Assistant, referencing our custom components library and other necessary files: /api/v1/system/self-program configurations as part of the system AI management for a seamless integration)

This is for opportunity: Custom Software Development for SMBs
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
