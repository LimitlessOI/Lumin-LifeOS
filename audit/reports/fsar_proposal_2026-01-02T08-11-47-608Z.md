- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.sql with this complete content:

INSERT INTO tasks (status, description) VALUES ('pending', 'Add income drones column');
UPDATE users SET has_income_tracking = FALSE; -- Assuming a boolean flag for tracking purposes in the users table 
ALTER TABLE services ADD COLUMN if not exists service_drones BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;

This is for opportunity: LifeOS Quickstart Automation Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
