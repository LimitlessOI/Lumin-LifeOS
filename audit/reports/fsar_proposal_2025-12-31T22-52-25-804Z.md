idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/001_create_table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_info (
  user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  preferences JSONB
);

INSERT INTO user_info (email, preferences) VALUES ('user@example.com', '{"genre": "electronics", "price_range": [10, 50],"features": ["brand new"]}');

This is for opportunity: AI-Driven Market Analysis
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
