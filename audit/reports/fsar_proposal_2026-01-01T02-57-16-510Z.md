- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_5.sql with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
// Endpoint to queue tasks for an employee (simplified logic)
router.post('/employee/:employee_id/queue', async (req, res) => {
    // Implement task queuing mechanism here using req.body and Neon PostgreSQL queries 
    const result = await db.query(`INSERT INTO task_assignments(...)`, [...]);
    return res.status(201).json({ message: 'Task has been scheduled successfully', id: result.insertedId });
});
// Endpoint to fetch performance analytics (simplified logic)
router.get('/employee/:employee_id/performance', async (req, res) => {
    // Implement the retrieval of snapshots and aggregation for an employee here using req.params and Neon PostgreSQL queries 
    const result = await db.query(`SELECT * FROM snapshots WHERE employee_id = $1 ORDER BY timestamp DESC`, [req.params.employee_id]);
    return res.json(result);
});
// Endpoint to check for Stripe payment processing (read and log only) - not autonomous charge handling 
router.get('/checkout/:orderId/charge', async (req, res) => {
    // Implement the logging of orderID here using req.params as part of your read-only process before a manual review by staff or automated system checkpoints without autocharging for now. This is not fully autonomous but set up to be easily chargeable upon approval in future implementations with Stripe integration enabled and proper API setup (mock/test environment)
    const result = await db.query(`SELECT * FROM revenue WHERE orderId = $1`, [req.params.orderId]);
    return res.json(result); // This should ideally be read for logging purposes only, not to process payment directly 
});

Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
