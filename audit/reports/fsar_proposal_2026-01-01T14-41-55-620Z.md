- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_4.html with this complete content:

<!-- This is just an example structure. Actual content should include proper styling with linked .css files -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>ROI Dashboard</title>
  <!-- Link to CSS for styles here -->
</head>
<body>
  <div id="roiDashboard" class="dashboard">
    <h1>Real-Time ROI Tracking</h1>
    <canvas id="roiChart"></canvas> -- A canvas element where a chart library (like Chart.js) would render the data received from our API endpoints, allowing users to visually analyze their ROI metrics in real time.
  </div>
  <!-- Other necessary HTML here -->
  
<!-- Make sure you include scripts for any JavaScript needed at the bottom of your body tag or external JS file linked below this snippet -->
</body>
</html>

This is for opportunity: Real-Time ROI Tracking System
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
