idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/create-customers-table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Customers (
    customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE CHECK (email LIKE '%@%.%' AND LENGTH(REGEXP_REPLACE(email, '@', '', 'g')) > 4), // Simplified regex for validating emails. Not fully compliant with RFC standards but serves as a basic checker
    createdAt TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

This is for opportunity: AI-Driven Marketing Services
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
