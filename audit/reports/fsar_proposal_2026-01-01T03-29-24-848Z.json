This setup includes configuring endpoints for handling charge captures or processing payments through invoices where appropriate (`/api/v1/billing` etc.), implementing business rules around when charges should be captured, integrating with Stripe's API as per requirements provided above (not fully detailed here due to scope limitations).\n\nThis is for opportunity: Automation Strategy Consulting\nMake sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.",
