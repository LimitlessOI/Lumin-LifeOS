idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.sql with this complete content:

// ChatBotUI.js - A simplified representation of the chatbot UI in React Native using functional components and hooks for state management, e.g., useState & useEffect
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';

export default function ChatBotUI() {
  const [inputText, setInputText] = useState(''); // Holds the user's message input for chatbot interaction
  
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.messageContainer}>{/* Displayed messages from previous conversations */}</Text>
      {/* Input field where users can type their questions or commands -->*/}
      <TextInput
        placeholder="Type your message here..."
        value={inputText}
        onChangeText={setInputText} // Updates the state with each change in input by user, triggering re-renders for chatbot interaction display and further NLU processing if needed.
        style={styles.inputField}
      />
    end of ChatBotUI.js example code snippet===END FILE===

This is for opportunity: Customized AI Chatbot Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
