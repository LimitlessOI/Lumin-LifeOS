# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_647ea1d6-1734-463f-bc4f-8a09ff0d5f40
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T02:45:12.718Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file /config/database.js with this complete content:

const dotenv = require('dotenv'); // Load environment variables from .env file 
dotenv.config();  
// Connect to Neon PostgreSQL database, define connection string using process.env variables ...
module.exports = { connectDB: async function() /* logic for DB connections */ };

This is for opportunity: Game Overlay Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
