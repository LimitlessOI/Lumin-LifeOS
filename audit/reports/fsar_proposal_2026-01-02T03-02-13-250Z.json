Ensure sensitive information is handled securely, adhering to best practices and Railway's specifications\n  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\n  updated_at TIMESTAMP, -- This will be automatically managed by ActiveRecord in Rails with timestamps for each record creation/update. The 'updated_at' column should reflect the time of last modification to a user-related entry unless overridden explicitly within controller actions or directly via raw SQL statements (not recommended without specific need).\n  role VARCHAR(20) CHECK (role IN ('admin', 'subscriber')) -- Assuming roles are limited based on subscription status, this field may be needed for access control as per plan details involving CRUD operations related to subscriptions and course management. This is a simplistic approach; consider migrating towards more scalable role-based authorization solutions in the future\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS courses (\n  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n  title VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,\n  description TEXT,\n  level ENUM('beginner', 'intermediate', 'advanced') DEFAULT 'beginner', -- This represents the difficulty of a course. Levels can be changed as per plan requirements or user feedback for AI curation considerations to match learner capabilities and progression paths accordingly with necessary indexing on this field if it's expected to be frequently queried\n  language ENUM('Python', 'JavaScript') NOT NULL, -- Example languages; expand based on actual course content availability as part of the platform requirements. Indexing can also benefit performance for frequent queries like filtering or sorting courses by these fields in real-time user experiences with AI curation considerations within Rails backend and frontend components developed accordingly\n  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENTCTRL; -- Again, ActiveRecord will handle this automatically as needed. Ensure that appropriate timestamps are included for course lifecycle tracking on the platform development stage (Railway). This includes creation/update records in Neon PostgreSQL database schema design and reflecting them appropriately within frontend components if required\n);\n\nCREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_course_language ON courses(language); -- Indexes are recommended for frequently queried fields like course language to improve query performance, especially important during the API development phase (Days 4-10) as per plan details when establishing a scalable and performant database schema design in Rails with Neon PostgreSQL.\n\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS subscriptions (\n  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n  user_id INT REFERENCES users(id), -- Referential integrity ensures relationships between tables are maintained within the system for robust end-to-end functionality as required by plan details during API development phase. This setup assumes a many-to-one relationship where one subscription is related to one user, which can be expanded based on actual platform requirements\n  course_id INT REFERENCES courses(id), -- Maintaining referential integrity for subscriptions also relates back to the specific 'courses' they are associated with. This setup assumes that a single subscription could relate to multiple users or vice versa, depending upon the business logic of LifeOS as per plan details during API development phase (Days 4-10)\n  status ENUM('active', 'cancelled', 'expired') DEFAULT 'active' -- Status tracking for each user's subscriptions is essential. This setup tracks whether a subscription remains active, was cancelled by the user or expired based on terms as required in Rails backend during API development phase (Days 4-10)\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS progress (\n  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n  course_id INT REFERENCES courses(id), -- Ensuring proper referential integrity between user's progression and the respective course they are learning from as required by plan details during API development phase (Days 4-10) in Rails backend. This field tracks individual progress on a per-user basis for each specific 'courses'.\n  status VARCHAR(50), -- Representing current state of user's progression within the course, which could be values like ('started', 'in_progress', 'completed') based upon plan details as required during API development phase (Days 4-10) in Rails backend. This setup ensures that any updates to progress are immediate and consistent across both frontend components developed accordingly on Railway stage (live), if necessary, through ActionCable subscriptions\n);\n\n-- Additional table creations for other relevant models such as `transactions` may be required based on the plan details related revenue capture mechanisms integration with Stripe payments and tracking ROI within Rails backend during API development phase. Implementing these transactions tables will involve setting up necessary foreign keys, indexing where needed to optimize query performance especially important for financial data handling in a production environment\nCOMMIT; -- Finalizing database schema changes by committing the migration after thorough testing as required before deployment on Railway's live stage (Day 31) and during API development phase. Ensure that all migrations have been successfully applied, verified against existing schemas to maintain data integrity across releases in a Rails application\n\nThis is for opportunity: Subscription-based Coding Tutorials\nMake sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.",
