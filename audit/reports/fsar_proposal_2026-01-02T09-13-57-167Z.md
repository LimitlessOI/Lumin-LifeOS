idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `UserInteractions` (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  contentId INT NOT NULL REFERENCES contents(`contentId`),
  userId BIGINT UNSIGNED DEFAULT NULL COMMENT 'The User ID',
  interactionTime TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON CONFLICT (`userId`, `interactionTime`) DO UPDATE SET ..., -- Update logic here if needed for handling duplicates or conflicts.

This is for opportunity: AI-Driven Content Marketing
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
