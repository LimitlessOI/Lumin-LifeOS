- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.sql with this complete content:

---FILE:migrations/003_create_stripe_integration.sql---
INSERT INTO stripe_integrations (name, status, created_at) VALUES ('Stripe Integration', 'active', NOW());
CREATE TRIGGER payment_confirmation AFTER INSERT ON payments FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE send_payment_notification();
---END FILE===

This is for opportunity: AI-Driven Business Process Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
