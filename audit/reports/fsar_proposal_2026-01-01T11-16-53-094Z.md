- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_6.js with this complete content:

// monitorProgressAndBehavior.js - Implementing real-time monitoring for user behavior and project progress using Railway's built-in tools or any other preferred toolset like Datadog, New Relic etc: (This is a placeholder as actual implementation can vary based on the chosen tool)
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
// ... Implement necessary routes to capture user behavior data and project progress...

This is for opportunity: Overlay Game Development Kit
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
