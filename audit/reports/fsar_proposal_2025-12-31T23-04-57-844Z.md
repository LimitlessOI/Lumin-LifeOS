- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api_v1/getSeoMetrics.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
const { getSEOMetrics } = require('../services/seomService'); // Assume this service handles API logic including database interaction with Neon ORM and MongoDB for data storage (if required in the future) as of now, we're mocking it since actual implementation would need a real DB setup which is beyond scope.

router.get('/', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const metrics = await getSEOMetrics(); // This function needs to be implemented with Neon ORM and MongoDB logic in production environment handling fetching SEO data points based on domain or keyword queries from the client's website. For mock purposes here: fixed sampled responses are returned directly for demonstration.
    res.json(metrics);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
  }
});

module.exports = router;

This is for opportunity: AI-Powered SEO Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
