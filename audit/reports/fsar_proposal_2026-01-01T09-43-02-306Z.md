- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_13.js with this complete content:

#### Load Testing #####/server.js: 
(Load test code utilizing Railway's robust-magic platform to simulate user traffic scenarios and monitor system performance)

This is for opportunity: Automated Invoice Processing
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
