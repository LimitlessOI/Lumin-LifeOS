- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file /src/db/migrations/002_create_educationContentTable.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS educational_content (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  scenario_id INTEGER REFERENCES scenarios(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  lesson_name VARCHAR(100),
  content TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT (NOW()),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT (NOW())
);

This is for opportunity: Make.com Scenario Generation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
