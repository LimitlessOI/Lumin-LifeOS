- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/create_campaigns_table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS campaigns (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  start_date TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  end_date TIMESTAMPTZ,
  targeted_audience JSONB, -- assuming audience segmentation is complex and stored as structured data (JSON document)
);

This is for opportunity: Online Funnel Optimization Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
