idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.js with this complete content:

const { createNewFreelancer, getTasksByStatus } = require('../services/freelanceService'); // Mock service for the example sake
// Assume necessary imports and database setup are already in place including JWT tokens handling, Stripe integration if needed

exports.createTask = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const taskDetails = req.body; // Simplified task creation logic based on request body content
    await createNewFreelancer(taskDetails); // Mock function to add a freelancer and generate unique ID for tasks
    
    return res.status(201).json({ message: 'Task created successfully', id: uuidV4() });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating task: ', error);
    // Error handling logic, sending appropriate response to the client
    res.status(500).send('An unexpected error occurred');
  }
};

exports.getTasksByStatus = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const statusFilter = req.params.status; // Assume ':status' is a URL parameter for filtering tasks by completion state
    let results = await getTasksByStatus(statusFilter); // Mock function to fetch tasks based on the provided filter and return them in response body
    
    res.json({ message: 'Successfully retrieved', data: results });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error retrieving tasks by status: ', error);
    // Error handling logic, sending appropriate response to the client
    res.status(500).send('An unexpected error occurred');
  }
};

Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
