- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file db/migrate/20190715063400_create_products.rb with this complete content:

```ruby
class CreateProducts < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0] # Rails uses Migrations to define database structure changes, but you can adapt the below script for Neon PostgreSQL if necessary on Railway platform:
  def change
    create_table :products do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.decimal :price, precision: 10, scale: 2
      t.references :category, foreign_key: true # If 'Category' is another model in Rails that represents a category of products e.g., via polymorphic association or regular join table for many-to-many relationships. Adjust as necessary.
      
    end
    
    # Seed data example - not part of migration, can be placed into seeds file if used: 
    Product.create!(name: 'Sample Product', price: 9.99, category_id: <category_id>)
  end

This is for opportunity: Quick-start SaaS Cloning
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
