- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file tests/campaignController.test.js with this complete content:

const request = require('supertest'); // Supertest is used with an Express app 
const { executeAnalysis } = require('../controllers/campaignController'); // hypothetical function from the controller file not implemented here  
describe('Campaign Management', () => {
    it('creates a new campaign and retrieves all campaigns successfully', async () => {
        const response = await request(app)
            .post('/campaign')
            .send({ name: 'Test Campaign' })
            // Response status expected here is 201 Created. Further tests for content would follow...
    });
});

This is for opportunity: AI-Driven Marketing Services
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
