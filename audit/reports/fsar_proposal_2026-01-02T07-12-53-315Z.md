idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_4.js with this complete content:

===END FILE===

### `routes/api.js`  (API Endpoints)
The following routes handle different functionalities of our service: user registration, authentication for the main portal and submission of files to be reviewed; as well as handling subscription payments via Stripe API which is triggered on POST request at `/api/v1/incomes`. All these end-points interact with other services like Phi-3 Mini (Local) & Neon PostgreSQL database for user and code data management.

This is for opportunity: Automated Code Review Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
