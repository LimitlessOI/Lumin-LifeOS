- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.sql with this complete content:

// routes/index.js (Dockerfile setup, api endpoints)
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

router.post('/order', async(req, res) => {
    const orderDetails = req.body; // Assuming this is populated with the necessary data from frontend form submission or other sources.
    
    try {
        await db('cloned-saas-applications').insert({...});
        return res.status(201).send(); 
    } catch (error) {
        // Handle errors here, such as database insertion failure
        console0.log(error);
        return res.status(500).send('Error adding new SaaS clone');
    end;
});
// ... additional routes for other CRUD operations on cloned-saas applications (create, read, update and delete) would follow here...

This is for opportunity: SaaS Cloning and Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
