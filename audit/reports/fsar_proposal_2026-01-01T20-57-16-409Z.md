idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.sql with this complete content:

===FILE:db/migrate/2023_XXXXXX_create_users_table.sql===
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
-- Ensure table is dropped if it exists and then created anew with the appropriate schema for GDPR compliance where necessary (e.g., using hashed personal info)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash TEXT NOT NULL, -- Assuming passwords are stored as hashes for security purposes
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
-- Define index on the user's email if necessary to improve search performance (e.01:DATABASE MIGRATION FILE FOR USER TABLE IN postgresql===CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_email ON users(email);===END OF DATABASE MIGRATION FILE===

This is for opportunity: Online Income Funnel Design
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
