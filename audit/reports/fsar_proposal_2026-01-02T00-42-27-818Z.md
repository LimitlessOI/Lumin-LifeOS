- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file src/components/UserProfile.js with this complete content:

import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; // For type checking props in functional component or similar package for class based on your setup.
const UserProfile = ({ userData }) => ( /* Your JSX code to display the user profile */ );
// Define prop types and default values as necessary using React's built-in tools, such as PropTypes library 
UserProfile.propTypes = {
    userData: PropTypes.shape({/* ... shape of expected props here...*/}).isRequired,
};
UserProfile.defaultProps = { /* Define defaults if needed */ };

This is for opportunity: Personalized Learning Platforms
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
