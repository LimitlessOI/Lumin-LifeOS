idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_9.css with this complete content:

"scripts": {
  "test": "mocha --reporter spec 'tests/**/*.js'" // Replace with actual test command for the project  
},
"devDependencies": {
  "@aws-sdk/serverless-jasmine",
  "run tests and deploy to Heroku using GitHub Actions or Jenkins CI pipeline (omitting real commands) here...
}

This is for opportunity: Stripe + Online Funnel Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
