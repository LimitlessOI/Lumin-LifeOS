# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_6f663e18-2211-4fee-9829-e240129f2cdf
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T11:28:35.605Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.js with this complete content:

2. **Script Generation Service (`/api/v1/generate_script`)** - This endpoint leverages NLP techniques to interpret user requests and map them with pre-existing logic templates stored in `script_logic`. It returns generated scripts or appropriate error messages if the input is not understood, following a robust script generation process that scales according to demand.

This is for opportunity: Custom Automation Script Generation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
