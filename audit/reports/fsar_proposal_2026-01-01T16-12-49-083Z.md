BEGIN TRANSACTION;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS businesses (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(191) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(191) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(20),
    industry_type VARCHAR(191),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
COMMIT;

This is for opportunity: Automation Workflow Consulting
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
