idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_5.css with this complete content:

{
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "/config/server_settings.js",
      "content": `export const SERVER_SETTINGS = ${JSON.stringify({"ip_address": "127.0.0.1","port":3000})};`  // Example, no external code or explanations here!
    }

This is for opportunity: Personalized Learning Paths for Professionals
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
