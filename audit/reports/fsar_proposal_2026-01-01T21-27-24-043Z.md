# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_6f4451de-6965-44cc-b988-f52d01c0e462
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T21:27:24.043Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file config/stripe_config.js with this complete content:

const stripe = require('@railway/stripe'); // Hypothetical Railway-specific Stripe configuration module, implement the details as per LifeOS AI Council's requirements and best practices for security (e.g., using environment variables or secure storage solutions to handle API keys).

module.exports = stripe; 
```

This is for opportunity: Stripe Funnel Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
