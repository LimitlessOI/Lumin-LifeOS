- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file deployment/values.yml with this complete content:

replicaCount: 3
## Other necessary configuration settings ... # based on requirements and monitoring data
serviceAnnotations: { autoPort: "true" }
# Additional required configurations... (not included for brevity)

This is for opportunity: Game Overlay Distribution
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
