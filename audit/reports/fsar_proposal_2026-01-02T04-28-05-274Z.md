# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_9d9cedf9-9bf4-4be7-b4ac-8741f4046249
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T04:28:05.274Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file producers/api_endpoint.py with this complete content:

```python
from kafka import KafkaProducer
# Assume necessary imports for authentication and SSL are already done here

def send_message(topic, value):
    producer = KafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers=['kafka-broker:9092'], security_protocol='SSL', ssl_cafile='/path/to/ca.pem')
    
    future = producer.send(topic, key=b'key', value=value)  # Send the message to Kafka
```

This is for opportunity: Tech Business Duplication
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
