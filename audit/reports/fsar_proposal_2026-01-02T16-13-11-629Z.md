- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_4.css with this complete content:

{
  "server": {
    "ip_address": "127.0.0.1", // Localhost for development purposes only! Change as needed.
    "port": 3000,
    "routes": ["/temperature"], # Temperature control route defined in 'API Routes' above code snippet (express_js)
    "dataEndpoint": "/api/seismic-wave" // Endpoint for raw seismic data collection and processing. Implement this with Express Router.
  },
  "frontendComponents": {
    "liveDataDisplay": false, # Optional - if we want to display realtime results on a webpage or app interface using React Native components (or similar technology). If not needed: remove the frontend component file and skip setting up a web server for live data. The 'server' object in JSON will remain unchanged
  }
}

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
