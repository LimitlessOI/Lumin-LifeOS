# FSAR Proposal Report

- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.js with this complete content:

// routes/api.js (JavaScript code for Express router with necessary API endpoints)
const express = require('express');
const stripe = require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET); // Make sure to set your Stripe secret key in the environment variables
const apiRouter = express.Router();

// Internal helper functions for handling payments and inventory management could be included here as needed, e.g.:
async function createUser(req, res) {
  try {
    const newUser = await stripe.customers.create({
      email: req.body.email, // Assuming the user data is sent via POST request with an 'email' field in JSON body format for authentication purposes
      name: req.body.name,
      payment_method: "stripe"
    });
    await createGameProgressRecord(newUser); // Placeholder function call to link account creation 
    return res.status(201).json({ message: 'Account created', userId: newUser.id });
  } catch (error) {
    consoles.log('Error during User Creation');
    throw error;
  end file===

This is for opportunity: Overlay Game Development Kit
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
