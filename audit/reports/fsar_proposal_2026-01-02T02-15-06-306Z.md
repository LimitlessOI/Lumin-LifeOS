- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.sql with this complete content:

BEGIN TRANSACTION;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_profile (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL, email VARCHAR(255), created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

This is for opportunity: Stripe Integration Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
