- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.js with this complete content:

*Phase 2 - Microservice Development and Expansion (Day 6-30)*  
**Technical Architecture:** Continue using FastAPI within Docker containers, now enhanced with gRPC for efficient inter-process communication between the task queueing service and income recording system. Implement robust logging mechanisms to record Stripe transactions via webhooks into Neon PostgreSQL without autonomous charge handling (maintaining 'monitoring').

This is for opportunity: Custom Software Solutions
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
