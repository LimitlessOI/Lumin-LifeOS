idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api.js with this complete content:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
require('dotenv').config();
// Stripe and MongoDB connection setup...
router.get('/opportunities', async (req, res) => {
  // Fetch opportunities from Neon PostgreSQL database with indexing for performance optimization during peak hours
});
router.post('/program-offer', async (req, res) => {
  // Create a new business opportunity offer using Stripe and MongoDB interaction here...
});
// Other CRUD operations on BusinessOpportunitiesModel...
module.exports = router;
```

This is for opportunity: Online Business Duplication Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
