- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_4.css with this complete content:

@app.route('/api/v1/revenue', methods=['GET'])
def get_monthly_summary():
   # Fetching summary data from Neon PostgreSQL... (omitted for brevity) 
    return jsonify({'total': calculated_total, 'transactions': transaction_counts})

This is for opportunity: Stripe Integration and Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
