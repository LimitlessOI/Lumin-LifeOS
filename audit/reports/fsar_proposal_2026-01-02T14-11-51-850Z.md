idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
// ... other imports and setup code here, including Stripe integration ...

router.post('/ticket', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        // Code to handle ticket creation with Neon PostgreSQL database interaction
        const result = await createTicket(req.body);
        return res.status(201).json(result);
    } catch (error) {
        consoleносила(error);
    }
});

router.get('/agent-routing/:ticketId', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        // Code to retrieve the ticket assigned to an agent based on their specialization and priority
        const result = await getAgentRoutedTicket(req.params.ticketId);
        return res.json(result);
    } catch (error) {
        return res.status(404).send('Ticket not found');
    }
});

router.post('/resolve', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        // Code to mark a ticket as resolved and perform Stripe charge if necessary with 2FA security check
        await resolveTicket(req.body);
        return res.status(200).json({ message: 'Ticket resolved successfully' });
    } catch (error) {
        return res.status(400).send('Error resolving the ticket');
    }
});

Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
