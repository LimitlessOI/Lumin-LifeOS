# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_7c4c6611-5f38-4679-af81-b0636589de4d
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T10:42:50.551Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file /src/routes/api.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
// Assume 'db' is a Sequelize instance with the EducationalContent model attached to it, and `scenarios` object from Make.com scenario service available here as well... (omitted for brevity)
router.get('/education-content/:id', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const content = await db.EducationalContent.findByPk(req.params.id); // Look up educational material by ID from the Make.com scenario database
    if (!content) throw new Error('Educational Content not found');
    
    res.json({ id: content.id, lesson_name: content.lesson_name, content: Buffer.from(content.content).toString() }); // Convert TEXT data to a string for JSON transmission (for large files consider using streaming)
  } catch {...//Omitted Error handling and translator API call placeholders as before}

This is for opportunity: Make.com Scenario Generation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
