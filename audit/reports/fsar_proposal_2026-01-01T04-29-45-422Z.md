- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.js with this complete content:

// models/Order.js
const Sequelize = require('sequelize');
module.exports = function (sequelize) {
  return sequelize.define('order', {
    userId: Sequelize.STRING, // Assuming the User model has a UUID primary key type for simplicity here too
    totalAmount: Sequelize.FLOAT,
    status: Sequelize.ENUM(['pending', 'paid', 'cancelled']),
    paymentMethodStripeId: Sequelize.STRING // Storing the unique ID provided by Stripe for reference in future operations
  }, {});
};

This is for opportunity: Stripe Integration Consulting
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
