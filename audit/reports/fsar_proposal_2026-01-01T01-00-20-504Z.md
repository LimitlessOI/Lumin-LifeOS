- timestamp: 2026-01-01T01:00:20.504Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file tests/customerSupport.test.js with this complete content:

const request = require('supertest'); // Example testing library for API endpoints with Express applications ... 
describe('/api/v1/interactions', () => { /* Unit tests including interaction threading, NLP responses */ });
// Additional test files and cases go here...
module.exports = {};

This is for opportunity: AI-Powered Customer Support Chatbots
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
