idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.sql with this complete content:

-- routes/migrations/001_create_products.sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS products (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    price NUMERIC(10, 2) NOT NULL CHECK (price >= 0),
    stock_quantity INT CHECK (stock_quantity >= 0),
    category TEXT
);

This is for opportunity: E-commerce Automation Packages
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
