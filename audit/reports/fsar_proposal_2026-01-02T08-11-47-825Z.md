idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_5.css with this complete content:

{
  "database_password": "", -- Placeholder; should be set in environment variables securely, not hard-coded
  "railway_api_key": ""    -- Same as above for Railway access API key
}

This is for opportunity: LifeOS Quickstart Automation Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
