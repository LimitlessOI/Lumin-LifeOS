idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_5.js with this complete content:

-- Additional tables creation script including `subscriptions` table with foreign keys pointing back to 'users' & courses', as well as potentially necessary fields like status and timestamps for tracking subscription states within Rails backend during API development phase (Days 4-10). Ensure indexing where appropriate, especially important in financial data handling scenarios.

This is for opportunity: Subscription-based Coding Tutorials
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
