# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_cba4f2bc-149d-4694-bc7a-d8d5bf487419
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T08:11:47.771Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_4.js with this complete content:

require('dotenv').config(); // Assuming .env file is set up for local development with production values ready to be swapped out on Railway deployment
const { RAILWAY_HOST, STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY } = process.env;
module.exports = {RAILWAY_HOST, STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY}; -- Exported variables for easy access in the application codebase

This is for opportunity: LifeOS Quickstart Automation Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
