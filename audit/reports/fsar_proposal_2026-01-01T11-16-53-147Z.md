- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_7.js with this complete content:

require('dotenv').config(); // Ensure you have dotenv installed & .env file for environmental settings. In production, use Stripe's CLI tool `stripe keys` command instead of hardcoding API secrets directly into the codebase. 
const stripe = require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET); // Replace 'your-secret-key' with actual secret key obtained from Stripe CLI in real environment setup not within this example for security reasons: (This is a placeholder and should be replaced by the appropriate method of retrieving API keys)
// ... Rest of stripe integration code using `stripe` object goes here, following best practices...

This is for opportunity: Overlay Game Development Kit
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
