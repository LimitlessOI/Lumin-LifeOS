# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_58997299-a505-4d7e-9735-d1db82c223f2
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T15:11:47.018Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
const { exec } = require('child_process'); // For self-programming endpoint integration testing with Make.com templates if needed in the future but not required now, as it's a placeholder for this plan phase and we are focusing on Railway execution here.
// ... other necessary imports like jsonwebtoken or express itself... 

router.post('/scenarios', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        // Validate input fields - name, description, revenue_projection from the request body before proceeding to save it in Neon PostgreSQL database using Sequelize ORM or raw SQL query executions. 
        
        const newScenario = await CustomScenariosModel.create(req.body); // Assuming there is a 'CustomScenariosModel' corresponding model created for the custom_scenarios table with appropriate fields and validations in place, which Sequelize or raw SQL would handle if necessary here as well
        
        res.status(201).send({ id: newScenario.id }); // Send back a response containing Scenario ID generated by Neon PostgreSQL for tracking within the Lightweight Assistant system queue. 
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error creating scenario', error);
        res.status(400).send({ message: 'Invalid input data' }); // In a production environment, handle this with proper logging and status codes as required by the API specification design/plan phase here which is not covered in detail since it should be consistent with Railway standards for handling common HTTP responses like 201 Created or 4xx client errors.
   09:35 - Revenue Capture Mechanism ### Custom Make.com Scenarios (Continued) ####
```javascript
// ... rest of the Express route handlers including other routes...

This is for opportunity: Custom Make.com Scenarios
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
