- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file helpers/generate_report.js with this complete content:

const getReport = async (id) => {
  // Logic here would query the materialized view or perform complex aggregation to generate report data...
};
export default getReport;

This is for opportunity: AI-Driven Market Analysis Reports
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
