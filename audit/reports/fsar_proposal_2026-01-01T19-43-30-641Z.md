# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_55ebca93-ba6f-47a9-9bc4-0dfd12f57965
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T19:43:30.641Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.js with this complete content:

// Assuming Railway and Kubernetes setup is already done in the environment settings file:
const express = require('express');
const { exec } = require('child_process'); // For executing shell commands for orchestration.
require('dotenv').config();

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
// ... rest of your server code setup...

This is for opportunity: Custom Software Development for SMBs
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
