- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_4.js with this complete content:

// File: routes/api.js
const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
const stripe = require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY); // Ensure this environment variable is set in Railway or your deployment configuration file before production use.
const { Op } = require('sequelize'); // For handling operations on database (foreign keys).

// Endpoint to submit code for review - abstracted as it requires backend logic and AI processing not covered here. Assume a function `processCodeSubmission` exists that handles the submission internally.
router.post('/code-review', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const jobId = processCodeSubmission(req.body.code); // This is an abstracted example of submitting and processing code review with a unique identifier 'jobId'. Actual implementation details are omitted as per instruction constraints but should be implemented in the backend logic, not within these API endpoints files directly.
        res.status(202).json({ jobId, status: "pending" }); // Responds immediately after submission with a pending status and provides more detailed response on completion of processing internally by microservices running this codebase (not included in the provided plan but required to be implemented accordingly).
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).json({ message: 'Internal Server Error' }); // Handles any errors during submission process, including issues with AI processing logic which is abstracted out from this endpoint definition as per instruction constraints for concise example purposes only.
    }
});

This is for opportunity: AI-Powered Code Review Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
