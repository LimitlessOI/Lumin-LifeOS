- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file server/routes/tasks/index.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
// Requires and imports other modules like task controllers here...

module.exports = function(app) {
    const tasksRouter = express.Router();
    
    // CRUD operations for Tasks API, e.g.:
    app.get('/tasks', getTasks); 
    app.post('/tasks', createTask);  
    app.put('/tasks/:id', updateTask);     
    app.delete('/tasks/:id', deleteTask);    
    
    tasksRouter(app);
};

This is for opportunity: Remote Team Management Software
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
