  "proposal": "self_improvement:  To address the issues identified, we need to focus on several key areas to improve our system's performance and stability. Here are some specific, actionable improvements:\n\n### 1. Reducing Friction in Monetization Flows\n- **Enhanced User Interface for Offer Management**: Implement a more user-friendly interface for creating and managing offers. This should include clear forms with validation rules to ensure all necessary fields are filled out correctly before submission.\n- **Automated Email Sequences**: Develop automated email sequences that guide users through the monetization process, ensuring they complete tasks seamlessly without getting stuck or confused.\n- **Risk Management in Offer Creation**: Introduce risk assessment tools during offer creation to prevent offers with potential legal or ethical issues from being published. This can include AI-driven checks for compliance and user safety.\n\n### 2. Improving ROI Visibility\n- **Real-Time ROI Tracking Dashboard**: Create a dashboard that provides real-time data on the Return On Investment (ROI) of each task. This should include graphs, charts, and filters to help users analyze performance easily.\n- **Advanced Analytics for Task Performance**: Implement advanced analytics tools to predict and track the success rates of tasks based on historical data and AI model insights.\n\n### 3. Keeping Safety and Ethics Intact\n- **AI Model Governance Framework**: Establish a governance framework around our AI models, including regular audits and updates to ensure they comply with safety and ethics standards.\n- **User Consent Management**: Ensure that all users provide explicit consent for the use of their data in monetization tasks. This can be done through a clear consent form during signup or a modal prompt before starting a new task.\n- **Ethical Code of Conduct for AI Usage**: Enforce an ethical code of conduct for using AI models in monetization, emphasizing fairness and transparency in all interactions with users.\n\n### 4. General Improvements Across the System\n- **Database Schema Optimization**: Review and optimize the database schema to ensure that it efficiently handles the current volume of tasks and user data without performance bottlenecks. This includes indexing strategies and table structure adjustments.\n- **Code Refactoring for Efficiency**: Conduct a thorough review of existing code, focusing on areas with high average duration, such as implementation ideas and self-improvements. Identify redundant or inefficient processes and refactor them to improve overall efficiency.\n\n### Implementation Steps:\n1. **Design Mockups and Prototypes**: Start by designing mockups for the new user interface components and dashboard prototypes. Get feedback from stakeholders and users before proceeding with development.\n2. **Develop and Test**: Develop the enhancements in stages, starting with the most critical ones (like the enhanced UI and real-time ROI tracking). Conduct thorough testing at each stage to ensure that the changes do not introduce new bugs or issues.\n3. **Deployment and Monitoring**: Deploy the improvements across the system. Set up monitoring tools to track performance metrics like task completion rates, user satisfaction, and ROI values. Make adjustments based on feedback from users and automated monitoring systems.\n4. **Continuous Improvement**: Implement a culture of continuous improvement where regular updates and enhancements are made based on ongoing user feedback, technological advancements, and regulatory changes.\n\nBy focusing on these improvements across the monetization flows, safety and ethics, and performance optimization, we can enhance the overall functionality and resilience of our system.",
