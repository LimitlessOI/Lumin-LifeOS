- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file api_routes.rb with this complete content:

```ruby
    ROUTES = [
      get '/webinars', to: 'webinars#index' # List all webinars...
      
      post '/webinars/attendees/:id', to: 'attendances#create', as: :new_attendance, constraints: lambda { |request| request.referral_token == params[:event_ref] }
    ]
    
    ROUTES += IntegrationRoutes # Assuming integration routes are defined here...
    ```
5. **Frontend Components Design** - Day 16 to 20: Create a user-friendly frontend interface using Rails view templates for creating and managing webinars/events, including forms with validation feedbacks, session timers etc., integrating live streaming video capabilities from services like Zoom or GoToWebinar. Queue as "Frontend Development."
    ===FILE:views/webinars/_form.html.erb===
    ```erb
    <%= form_with model: @webinar, url: webinars_path do |f| %>
      <div class="field">
        <%= f.label :event_title %><br>
        <%= f.text_field :event_title %>
      </div>
      
      # Additional fields and form for live streaming integration...
    <% end %>
    ```
6. **Integration Points Setup** - Day 21 to 23: Integrate real-time revenue tracking with Stripe via optional integration (optional), ensuring proper logging of transactions for analytics purposes, and ensure the Neon PostgreSQL database captures all necessary financial data securely. Queue as "Stripe & Database Financial Integration."
    ===FILE:stripe_config.rb===
    ```ruby
    Stripe::Setup.setup(ENV['STRIPE_SECRET'], Rails.application) do |app|
      app.customer = { first_name: params[:webinar][:attendee].first_name, email: params[:webinar][:attendee].email }
      
      # Additional customer setup for Stripe...
    end
    ```
7. **Testing Strategy Development** - Day 24 to 25: Develop comprehensive testing strategy focusing on automated event workflows, ensuring minimal manual effort in webinar/event management (e.g., Capybara with RSpec). Queue as "Testing Strategy Development."
    ===FILE:spec/models/webinar_spec.rb===
    ```ruby
    require 'rails_helper'
    
    RSpec.describe Webinar, type: :model do
      # Example test for webinar model...
      
      it "is valid" do
        expect(Webinar.new).to be_valid
      end

This is for opportunity: Webinar and Event Automation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
