- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_5.sql with this complete content:

2. Update `server.js` (or wherever your Express app initializes) to include rate limiting using express-rate-limit, Sequelize setup with PostgreSQL instead of SQLite, CORS configuration for security if needed, setting up Redis caching mechanism as well:

This is for opportunity: SaaS Cloning and Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
