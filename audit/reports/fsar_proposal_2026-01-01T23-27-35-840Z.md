- timestamp: 2026-01-01T23:27:35.840Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file database/migrations/2019_migration_create_overlays.sql with this complete content:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS overlays (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  settings JSONB, -- Assuming a nested object to store various configurations and options.
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);
```

This is for opportunity: Custom Game Overlay Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
