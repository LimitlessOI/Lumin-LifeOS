# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_b201abfa-e11e-405a-bd1d-e3af87a26104
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T19:43:30.843Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_5.js with this complete content:

const stripe = require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET); // Load Stripe API client with secret key from environment variables for security: /api/v1/system/self-program or Railway's native SSL feature setup if available, OAuth2 tokens management endpoint `/api/v1/auth` configured using `dotenv`.
// ... code to handle charge creation and refund logic...

This is for opportunity: Custom Software Development for SMBs
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
