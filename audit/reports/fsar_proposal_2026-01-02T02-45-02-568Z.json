The net value remains unchanged because all transactions were within capital contributions or withdrawals by themself which do not impact their initial investment directly in this context, but rather influence equity distribution for dividends later on.\n- Total taxable income before the sale: $210,786 - $35,495 + $30,000 = $195,391 (net of expenses)\n- Net worth difference due to partnership activities in 2022 is not directly calculated here as there are no transactions affecting the partner's individual net worth within this context. However, if we were considering personal taxes on a withdrawal and capital gains or losses from selling assets (which have occurred), those would be reflected accordingly after calculating gain/loss based on initial investment and sale price minus expenses related to asset sales.\n- The company is projected not to pay any cash dividends this year, as the net income has been reinvested back into the business for growth purposes (reinvesting in new equipment or R&D). Hence no impact on partners' personal wealth from these transactions: $0. \n\nThe initial investment by partner B was added to their capital account of only $13,254 and then withdracleness at the end yearly value which is not reflected here as it would be considered in subsequent years or when considering individual partners' contributions separately if needed for further analysis:\n- Partner A’s investment + net income - expenses = initial capital (no additional personal contribution): $10,568.24 \n+ Net Income after adjustments ($397,813) - Expenditure on equipment and R&D (-$21,593), minus the withdrawal from partner A's equity accounts: $-862,474 (represents a loss due to expenses not covered by net income).\n- Partner B’s investment + initial capital - withdracleness = ending balance for this year only ($13,254): $0. \n\nGiven the data and calculations above, here is an example of what financial statements might look like:\n\n**Balance Sheet as at December 31, Year-End (in dollars)**\n\nThis is for opportunity: Custom API Development\nMake sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.",
