# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_83de687a-6ebb-41e0-aba9-bbb0fc87aaef
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T11:12:36.597Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/2023_create_games_table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS games (
    game_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

This is for opportunity: Game Overlay Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
