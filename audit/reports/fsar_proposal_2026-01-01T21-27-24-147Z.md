- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file config/k8s_service.yml with this complete content:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: checkout-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: checkout-service # The label that matches the pod labels defined in your deployment, ensuring traffic is routed to correct instances of deployed containers.  
  ports:
    - protocol: "TCP"
      port: 80 # Accessible external port for users' requests; adjust as necessary based on needs and Railway’s backend capabilities.
  clusterIP: None # Set this field to 'None' if you want the service within a cloud provider-managed load balancer like AWS ELB or Google GCE LoadBalancer, otherwise remove it (default is when not set).  
```

This is for opportunity: Stripe Funnel Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
