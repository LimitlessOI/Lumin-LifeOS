### 5. Integration Points ###
**File: api/system/self-program.js (for logging and ROI tracking)**
```javascript
// Pseudocode, real implementation would depend on your specific requirements for self-programming logic within Railway's infrastructure
===FILE:api/system/self-program.js===
const { logEvent } = require('./logging');  // Placeholder path to the logging module in Railway

router.post('/', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const eventData = req.body;
        await logEvent(eventData);  // Log execution tasks and ROI tracking events here...
        
        res.status(201).send('Log recorded successfully');
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error logging self-program event:', error);
        res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
    }
});

This is for opportunity: Rapid Code Review Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
