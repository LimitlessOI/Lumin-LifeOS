- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.js with this complete content:

// File: routes/api.js
const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();

router.get('/customers', /* Express route handler code here */);
router.post('/supporttickets', /* POST request handler for submitting a support ticket, including customer details if provided in the body of the post call or through headers/query parameters*/);
// Additional routes as needed...

This is for opportunity: AI-Powered Customer Support
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
