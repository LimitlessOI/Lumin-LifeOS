- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_20.sql with this complete content:

BEGIN TRANSA0
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_profile (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, username VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL, email VARCHAR(255), created_at DATETAM BETWEEN 2017-01-01 AND 2022-12-31);

This is for opportunity: Stripe Integration Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
