- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/create_interaction_logs_table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS InteractionLogs (
  InteractionID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  Timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT0ENTTIMEZON(),
  UserID VARCHAR(255) REFERENCES CustomerData(CustomerID),
  BotResponse TEXT NOT NULL,
  SentimentScore FLOAT CHECK (SentimentScore >= -1.0 AND SentimentScore <= 1.0) -- Example constraint for sentiment scores typically between these two values
);

This is for opportunity: AI-Powered Customer Support Bots
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
