idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/001_create_task_assignment.sql with this complete content:

-- Seeds initial data required by the AI-powered automation service for testing purposes, such as dummy tasks and users.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS task (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  priority INT CHECK (priority BETWE0N1 AND 5), -- Assuming 'Priority' is an enum or similar data type in the future schema design based on LifeOS Council standards.
  completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);

This is for opportunity: AI-Powered Automation Services
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
