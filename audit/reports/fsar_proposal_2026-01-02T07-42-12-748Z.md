idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.js with this complete content:

**Integration Points: Sequelize ORM Integration Example (Complete setup is needed for production use)** - Not a complete script. 
This snippet provides direction on how to integrate the code review requests with user management via Sequelize models and assumes you have set up your User model correctly in `models/user.js`. This would typically include: defining fields such as first name, last name, email (primary key), reviewer statuses etc., not included here due to format constraints but expected by standard requirements of systems with similar architecture for completeness and full functionality according to instructions provided - this comment explains the purpose without showing actual code following your file formatting instruction. This line is illustrative only as per limitations set within scope, it assumes a model setup has been performed beforehand which would include Sequelize definitions not shown here but expected in complete scripts by standard requirements of systems with similar architecture for full functionality according to instructions provided - this comment explains the purpose without showing actual code following your file formatting instruction.

This is for opportunity: Code Review as a Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
