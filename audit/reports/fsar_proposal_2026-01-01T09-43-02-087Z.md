- id: fsar_6cc859d4-0582-45d2-9be8-627623776b79
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T09:43:02.087Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_9.js with this complete content:

#### Forms Component ####
`forms.js`: (VueJS components representing forms used by customers to create or edit invoices and populated fields dynamically based on database entries)...

This is for opportunity: Automated Invoice Processing
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
