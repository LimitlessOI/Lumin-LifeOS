- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file integration_selection.yml with this complete content:

```yaml
    - software: zenkit # for example, replace with actual data selection process results...
      integration_method: self_programming_endpoint('/api/v1/system/self-program')

This is for opportunity: Webinar and Event Automation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
