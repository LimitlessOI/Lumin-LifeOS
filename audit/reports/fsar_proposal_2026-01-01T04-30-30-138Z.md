# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_c0e5978c-b5ae-47bf-aaa7-ca5fefde03ae
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T04:30:30.138Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_5.js with this complete content:

// File: routes/paymentApi.js (Pseudocode) - Actual implementation will require proper setup using stripe SDK or library in the backend to handle payment processing asynchronously, error handling and logging based on business requirements. 
const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
router.post('/payment', capturePaymentHandler); // Placeholder function for capturing payments via Stripe API call with necessary precautions to handle sensitive financial information securely, including proper logging and error tracking mechanisms in place as per the company's policy on revenue capture within a 30 days window after campaign end.

This is for opportunity: Digital Product Launch Kit
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
