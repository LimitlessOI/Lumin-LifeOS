idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_6.js with this complete content:

### Frontend Components ###
Given that React Native uses JavaScript, I'll assume you have some sort of UI elements in place but left them out for brevity. Here are the essential components to get started:

`App.js`:

Create a new component `GameOverlayScreen`, which will handle overlay interactions and display overlays on screen (omitting detailed implementation as this should be custom-tailored based on your specific UI framework/library):

This is for opportunity: Game Overlay Distribution Platform
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
