- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS customers (
  customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  industry VARCHAR(100) CHECK (industry IN ('Healthcare', 'E-commerce', 'Finance')), -- Example industries
  location VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS services_requests (
  request_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id INT REFERENCES customers(customer_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  service_name TEXT,
  requested_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(), -- Captures the time of creation with timezone support for better accuracy.
  status VARCHAR(50),
  completion_time TIMESTAMP WITHO_OUTLOOK: This exercise doesn't provide a specific programming language or technology stack, and as requested to create self-contained functions that execute independently without relying on external libraries beyond standard Python includes (like `sys`, for instance). However, I will craft an example in GoLang because of its efficiency and ability to handle concurrency with goroutines. Please note this is a simplified representation assuming the use of Gorilla Mux as our web framework:

**`models/CustomerProfile.go`:** This file contains structs for Customer Profile including age groups, gender preferences (using enums), payment methods in JSON format to simplify future integration with Stripe API endpoints and other services if needed.

This is for opportunity: Custom Automation Services
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
