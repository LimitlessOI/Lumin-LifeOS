idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.js with this complete content:

// File: routes/api.js ===START OF FILE===
const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
const db = require('../models'); // Assume we have a models file set up for ORM operations with Neon PostgreSQL

router.get('/profiles', async (req, res) => {
    const profiles = await db.businessProfiles.find({});
    res.json(profiles);
});

// Additional endpoints would go here... --END OF FILE===

This is for opportunity: AI-Powered Business Consulting
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
