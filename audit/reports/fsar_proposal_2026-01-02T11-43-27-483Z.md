idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.css with this complete content:

===FILE:models/GameOverlayDistributionPlatformModel===""
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const GameSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    title: { type: String, required: true },
    developer: { type: String, required: true },
    platform: { type: String, required: true },
    price: Number, // Assuming we're using a simple numeric representation for the sake of this example; should be refined as per actual use case.
});

This is for opportunity: Game Overlay Distribution Platform
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
