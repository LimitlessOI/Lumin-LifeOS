  "proposal": "self_improvement:  To address the issues identified, we should focus on several key areas to improve the system's performance and functionality. Here are specific, actionable improvements:\n\n### 1. Resolving Current Errors\nThe primary error being reported is due to a missing column in the `execution_tasks` table. This can be resolved by either dropping the problematic tasks from the database or adding the missing column if it was mistakenly removed.\n\n**Action:**\n- **Database Migration:** Create a migration script to add the `ai_model` column to the `execution_tasks` table. Ensure that this step is thoroughly tested before deploying to production.\n  - **SQL Command (example):**\n    ```sql\n    ALTER TABLE execution_tasks ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS ai_model TEXT;\n    ```\n- **Backfill Data:** If possible, backfill the `ai_model` column with default values or NULLs for existing tasks to avoid immediate conflicts.\n\n### 2. Improving Performance Metrics\nThe performance bottlenecks identified suggest areas where optimization can be applied across different stages of development and execution:\n\n**Implement Ideas (avg duration too high):**\n- **Optimization in Task Assignment:** Review the criteria used for task assignment to AI models. Implement a more efficient algorithm that balances task complexity with available resources, potentially reducing average implementation time.\n  - **Algorithm Adjustment:** Use a weighted approach where tasks are assigned based on both urgency and model capabilities, ensuring better utilization of computational resources.\n\n**Idea Implementation (avg duration too high):**\n- **Parallel Processing:** Leverage asynchronous processing to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, which can significantly reduce the average implementation time if current bottlenecks are due to sequential execution.\n  - **Tech Stack Integration:** Consider upgrading or replacing technologies used for task handling and distribution in the backend to support more parallel operations.\n\n**Self-Improvement (avg duration too high):**\n- **Regular Updates and Upgrades:** Implement a scheduled maintenance window where the system undergoes routine updates and upgrades, including software patches and hardware refresh cycles. This can help maintain optimal performance over time without significant downtime.\n  - **Monitoring Tools:** Integrate or upgrade monitoring tools to proactively detect and address performance issues before they escalate.\n\n### 3. Enhancing Monetization Flows and ROI Visibility\nTo reduce friction in monetization flows and improve ROI visibility, consider:\n\n- **Real-Time Analytics Dashboard:** Develop a dashboard that provides real-time insights into income streams, expenses, and other financial metrics. This will help stakeholders monitor the performance of different services more closely.\n  - **Integration with Stripe API:** Enhance the integration to provide deeper analytics on revenue generated through online funnels. Use this data to make informed decisions about pricing strategies or service offerings.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy addressing these specific improvements, we can reduce friction in monetization flows, enhance ROI visibility, and ensure continuous performance improvement without compromising safety and ethics.",
