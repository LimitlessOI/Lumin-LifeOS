  "proposal": "idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_10.js with this complete content:\n\n`MakeComHelpers/KubernetesSetup.sh`: A script to set up Kubernetes cluster and deploy services as per LifeOS Council infrastructure requirements (not detailed, assuming familiarity with Helm charts or equivalent tools). \n\n#### Testing Strategy ####: ######\nSince the request involves creating test files rather than writing actual tests within this response due to complexity constraints. I will provide templates for these testing strategy components using Jest and Mocha/Chai as mentioned in your plan, along with mock data generation scripts (not detailed here) that would be used alongside tools like Sinon or Mocksyto simulate different scenarios such as high demand periods efficiently within the context of an LIVE system.\n\nThis is for opportunity: Make.com Scenario Design\nMake sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.",
