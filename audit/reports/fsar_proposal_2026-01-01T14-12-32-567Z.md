# FSAR Proposal Report

- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_6.js with this complete content:

#### Monitoring and Optimization #### (E.g., Prometheus configuration) *(File Paths vary by implementation)*
*Prometheus Configuration YAML file content here...  
Custom monitoring scripts or logic for analyzing performance metrics from tools like New Relic, etc. in a separate 'monitoring/' directory as needed to configure and run these services alongside the main application deployment (file paths: monitoring/)...  // Define Prometheus configuration files within the 'monitoring/' directory required to collect system-wide health checks data points for continuous performance evaluation against specific thresholds or key metrics of interest.

This is for opportunity: Overlay Game Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
