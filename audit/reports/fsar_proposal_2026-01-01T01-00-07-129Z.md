- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_6.css with this complete content:

/* dashboard-metrics.css */
@import 'chartkit2'; // This is just for demonstration; actual implementation would depend on the chosen chart library or custom stylesheets.

#playerMetricsDashboard {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-around; /* Spacing between widgets */
}

/* Add your specific CSS rules here, tailored to fit with your React Native UI/UX design standards */

This is for opportunity: AI Overlay for Game Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
