# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_bf876e47-22eb-4a33-8c44-ac8c0534603e
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T01:11:47.156Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file db/migrations/2023_create_purchases_table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS purchases (
    purchaseID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    userID INTEGER REFERENCES users(userID), -- assuming a 'users' table exists for this example
    overlayID INTEGER REFERENCES overlay_items(overlayID),
    timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    quantitySold INTEGER CHECK (quantitySold >= 0) NOT NULL
);

This is for opportunity: Game Overlay Distribution
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
