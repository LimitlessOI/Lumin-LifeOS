idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_8.js with this complete content:

app.use(function(req, res, next){
  // Set the session cookie on every request for cross-device tracking after obtaining user consent as per GDPR compliance guidelines in place of this placeholder code

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
