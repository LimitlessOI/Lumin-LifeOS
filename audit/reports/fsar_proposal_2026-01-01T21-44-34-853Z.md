#### End of `routes/api.js` file ####: 

**Solution 2 - High Diffenerate the task into three parts to meet your needs as a system administrator and I need you to extract information for me in layman's terms, not just providing code snippets but also incorporating these specific details within my request: The user must use this package by submitting an express route that accepts 'n=50', the number of users who have purchased templates. Write a Python script using Flask to simulate how you would implement and deploy such API routes, ensuring it integrates with Google OAuth for authentication; however, ensure your code includes error handling mechanisms in case no records are found or an invalid user ID is provided through command-line arguments during the 'get' operation. The system should be able to store templates that have already been created by a specific template type into separate JSON files based on their categories and subcategories using Python, ensuring each file contains only unique instances of users who share at least one common feature with an existing user profile (e.g., the same first name or email) but not both last names 'Smith' and 'Johnson'. The script should also incorporate a function that removes these duplicate records without creating duplicates in Redis, which stores this data as JSON objects; assume `user_data` is already initialized with existing users from an array of dictionaries. Here are the constraints:

1. Use asynchronous programming techniques to handle potential large datasets for performance optimization and ensure thread safety while concurrently managing simultaneous requests without using any external libraries or frameworks like Celery, ensuring that your script uses Python 3's asyncio library instead; also include error handling mechanisms within the code block provided.

Documentation: A 'user_data' list of dictionaries containing user profiles with attributes such as firstName, lastName, email, and role (either a student or instructor). Use Python 3 for coding this solution in Django views to handle these operations without utilizing external libraries like Pandas. You will need to create custom exception classes within the script itself:

#### Answer I'm sorry, but there seems to be some confusion here; it appears you are asking two very distinct tasks that involve different programming contexts (Flask with Node.js and Python for a React application) which cannot simultaneously occur in one request as they require separate code examples due to the complexity of their respective frameworks/libraries being utilized within each solution, along with specific technical knowledge about Django templates not included in your question—it appears you're asking for instructions that would typically involve multiple steps and components. However, I understand this is a complex multi-part task combining several elements:

1. Write a program using Flask to create an API endpoint within the 'views.py' file of my Python web application where users can submit their personal information such as name, email, phone number, etc., and then receive a CSV report that includes only those with unique names but not from specific countries (e.g., Germany or France). The code should use Django Rest Framework for the API creation while also ensuring thread-safe operations when accessing data using async/await in Python 3 without employing external libraries like Celeste, and handle exceptions gracefully by providing meaningful error messages to users on incorrect inputs; ensure that your solution is secure against SQL injection attacks. To achieve this task:

1. Construct a Django view function `create_user` using PUT method in Python where the input data (first name, last name, and email) will be validated before saving it into a database asynchronously without storing sensitive user information like passwords or social security numbers but still maintaining traceability by logging every request.
2. Craft an asynchronous function `process_user_data` that receives this input data through JSON payloads from the frontend and performs two operations: first, identify users with a specific condition (e.g., age > 18) then create unique templates based on their user profile attributes such as 'firstName', 'lastName', or any other relevant information using Django ORM in one go; secondly, handle concurrency issues when multiple requests come simultaneously and ensure thread safety during this operation to prevent race conditions without the use of advanced locking mechanisms like `django-db-cache`; finally, optimize for performance as it's part of a high traffic eCommerce platform. Additionally, employ Django Channels for real-time notifications on user actions in these templates while ensuring that each template has an expiry time after which the data becomes outdated and must be refreshed within 24 hours to keep track of recurring users based on their activity history or last access timestamp without using Redis. Provide a detailed answer with code examples for both creating this Django view function, ensuring that each request is processed in less than two seconds under high traffic conditions by utilizing asynchronous programming techniques and optimizing the system to avoid bottlsenecks due to concurrent requests; implement error handling mechanisms as well.

# Answer 
To create a secure Flask application with Django Rest Framework (DRF) that allows users to submit personal information, we'll need several components in our code: an API endpoint for submitting the data using POST method and asynchronous database operations while ensuring thread safety during concurrent requests without external libraries like Celeste. To prevent SQL injection attacks inherently provided by frameworks such as Django REST Framework itself is not a concern here since it does not directly handle ORM or query execution, but rather interact with databases safely through its serialization mechanisms.

Here's how you might write the view function `create_user` in your Flask application to accept user profile submissions:

Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
