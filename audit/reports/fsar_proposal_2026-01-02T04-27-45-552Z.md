# FSAR Proposal Report

- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
// Import your controllers or handle logic here if necessary, for example handling Stripe integration and WebSockets connection setup.

router.post('/auth', authController.authenticate); // Assuming you have an 'authController' to manage authentication flow with OAuth2.

router.get('/overlays', overlayController.listAvailableOverlays); // Assuming this controller handles listing available overlays via GET request, interacting with Graphic Designers as needed for generating these in real-time through WebSockets or server-sent events (if not fully handled by the frontend).
router.post('/overlays', overlayController.triggerOverlayGeneration); // POST to trigger specific overlays upon game access, which is managed via websockets connection setup between backend and React app's state management mechanism like Redux or Context API for real-time updates without full page refreshes with Phaser3 engine integration on the frontend side.
router.post('/revenue', revenueController.captureRevenueData); // Assuming this controller handles interaction with Stripe via `/api/v1/revenue` endpoint, capturing and logging income data for ROI tracking purposes after every invoice processing cycle completes using scheduled jobs or cron tasks to update the sales report daily based on logged interactions from `User_game_interactions`.

This is for opportunity: Game Development Overlay Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
