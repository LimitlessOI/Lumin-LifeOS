idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/002_create_automation_tasks_table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS automation_tasks (
  task_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  description TEXT,
  targeted_industry_sector VARCHAR(255),
  expected_outcome ROI DOUBLE PRECISION CHECK (expected_outcome > 0) DEFAULT NULL,
  status ENUM('draft', 'active', 'completed') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'draft'
);

This is for opportunity: Make.com Automation Scenario Design
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
