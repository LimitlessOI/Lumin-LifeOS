- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_5.js with this complete content:

// File: models/User.js (ORM model if using something like Sequelize)
const { Model, DataTypes } = require('sequelize');
class User extends Model {}
module.exports = User;

This is for opportunity: Virtual Workshop Series for Businesses
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
