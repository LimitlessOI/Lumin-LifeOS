idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_4.sql with this complete content:

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, TouchableOpacity } from 'react-native';
// Import Charting library and other necessary components here (Chart.js/Highcharts) 

const MakecomDashboard = () => {
    const [data, setData] = useState({}); // Replace with actual data fetched via API calls to the backend endpoints above using Axios or similar HTTP client within React Native environment on Railway platform infrastructure. Ensure secure Socket connections (TLS encryption). 
    
    useEffect(() => {
        const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
            // Fetch and update data periodically from API calls to backend endpoints above using Axios or similar HTTP client within React Native environment on Railway platform infrastructure. Ensure secure Socket connections (TLS encryption). 
        }, 60000); // Update every minute, adjust based on actual needs for dashboard freshness and performance considerations regarding data fetching from backend services over a WebSocket connection as per railway system specifics in the LifeOS AI Council's robust platform infrastructure. Ensure secure Socket connections (TLS encryption). 
        
        return () => clearInterval(intervalId); // Clean up interval on component unmount to prevent memory leaks
    }, []);
    
    const handleRefresh = () => {
        setData({}); // Call a function here that fetches data from the backend and updates state with new scenario information, using secure WebSocket connections (TLS encryption) as per railway system specifics in LifeOS AI Council's robust platform infrastructure. Ensure security by employing HTTPS/TLS for all interactions between client-side React Native app UI design and back end services over a secure channel within the Railway environment, ensuring data privacy protection via SSL pinning where possible as per railway system specifications in LifeOS AI Council's robust platform infrastructure.

This is for opportunity: Make.com Scenario Creation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
