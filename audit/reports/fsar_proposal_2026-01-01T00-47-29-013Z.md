# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_b6a124e0-b624-4cef-bcae-5cb589640611
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T00:47:29.013Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_5.js with this complete content:

// Additional frontend files for complete functional components not shown due to scope of this plan. -- End of file content ---===FILE:config/dotenv.env===### Configuration File (`dotenv.env`) ###

This is for opportunity: Automation Optimization Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
