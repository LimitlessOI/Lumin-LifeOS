idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.sql with this complete content:

// File: api/routes/api.js
const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const { validateUser, assignDeveloper } = require('./middleware/authMiddleware'); // Placeholder for auth middleware functions to be created later in the development process.
// ... other required imports like express-validator and bodyParser go here...

router.post('/users', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(req.body.password, 10);
        // Insert user into the database with a hashed password instead of plain text for security reasons...
        res.status(201).send('User created');
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(400).send({ message: 'Validation failed' });
    }
});

router.post('/developers', validateUser, async (req, res) => { // Placeholder for a user validation function to be defined later...
    try {
        const existingDeveloper = await pool.query('SELECT * FROM developers WHERE email = $1 AND password_hash = $2', [req.body.email, req.body.password]);
        
        if (existingDeveloper.rows.length) { // This is a simplistic approach and should be improved with proper error handling in production code...
            res.status(400).send('Email already registered');
        } else {
            const newUser = await pool.query('INSERT INTO users (name, email, password_hash) VALUES ($1, $2, $3) RETURNING id', [req.body.username, req.body.email, hashedPassword]); // Assuming user object contains name and the rest of their details...
            const developerId = newUser.rows[0].id;
            await assignDeveloper(developerId); // Placeholder for skill assignment based on AI algorithms to be implemented later in development process...
            
            res.status(201).send('New Developer added');
        } 
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).send({ message: 'Internal Server Error' });
    }
});

This is for opportunity: Freelance Platform for Developers
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
