# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_184a8803-3fc1-4473-9116-490694996d58
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T07:43:26.135Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file tests/scenarioCreator.spec.js with this complete content:

```javascript
// Unit Testing with Jest example (pseudocode as real test cases will depend on actual component logic):
describe('Scenario Creation', () => {
    // Your tests here ...
});
```

This is for opportunity: Rapid Make.com Scenario Generation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
