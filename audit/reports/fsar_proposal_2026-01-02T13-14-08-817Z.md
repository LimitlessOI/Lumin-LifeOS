- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api/v1/user_signup.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
// Assuming user authentication and hashing logic are implemented elsewhere, mocked here for brevity
router.post('/', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        // User sign-up logic goes here...
        const result = await createNewUser(req.body);
        return res.status(201).send({ userId: result.id });
    } catch (error) {
        return res.status(400).send({ message: 'Error creating user', error: error.message || 'Unknown Error' });
    })

This is for opportunity: Rapid SaaS Duplication
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
