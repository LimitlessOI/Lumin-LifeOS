- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/002_setup_user_schema.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password TEXT NOT NULL,
  role VARCHAR(10) CHECK (role IN ('reviewer', 'submitter')) DEFAULT 'submitter', # Define roles to control access within the system.
);

This is for opportunity: Code Review Express
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
