- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_7.sql with this complete content:

import React from 'react';
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux'; // This assumes Redux is used as state management in Railway AI Council's infrastructure (if not using Redux with Railsway)
const RealWorldMetricsDetection = () => {
    const metricsData = useSelector(state => state.realWorldMetrics); // Assuming a slice of store for real-world blind spots data is set up in the Railways AI Council's infrastructure and Redux (or equivalent) tools are employed.
    
    return (
        <div>
            {/* Real world metrics display logic */}
        </div>
    );
};

This is for opportunity: Online Funnel Optimization Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
