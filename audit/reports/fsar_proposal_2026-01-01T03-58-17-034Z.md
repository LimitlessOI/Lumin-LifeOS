- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.js with this complete content:

# alembic version control setup (not part of the initial request but necessary)
from alembic import command_executor as ace
import os
os.environ['ALEMBIC'] = 'env/test'  # Path to your Alembic env directory, usually in .gitignore or similar config file
ace.Script().upgrade()

This is for opportunity: Make.com Scenario Creation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
