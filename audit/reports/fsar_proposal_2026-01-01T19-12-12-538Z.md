- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file components/CourseListingModule.js with this complete content:

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';
// Assuming Redux or Context API is set up for state management in the application

const CourseListingModule = () => {
    const [courses, setCourses] = useState([]); // Initializing with empty array as placeholder data

    useEffect(() => {
        async function fetchData() {
            try {
                const response = await axios.get('/api/v1/courses');
                setCourses(response.data);
            } catch (error) {
                console.error('Error fetching course data:', error);
            }
        }
        
        fetchData(); // Call on mount and possibly periodically or when props change to refresh the listings as needed
    }, []); // Dependency array can be expanded if necessary, e.g., user ID for personalized recommendations

    return (
        <div>
            {courses.map(course => (
                <div key={course.id}>
                    <h3>{course.title}</h3>
                    <p>{course.description}</p>
                </div>
            ))}
        </div>
    );
};

Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
