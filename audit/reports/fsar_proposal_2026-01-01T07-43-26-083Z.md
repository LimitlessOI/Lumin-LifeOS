- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file components/ScenarioCreator.vue with this complete content:

```javascript
<template>
    <!-- Component logic here -->
</template>
<script lang="ts">
import { h } from 'vue-loader'; // Assumed syntax correction to use TypeScript with Vue; however, this is a conceptual representation as actual implementation will require setup in vue.config.js or using Vite's tsconfig settings:
export default { 
    name: "ScenarioCreator",
    components: {}, // Define your child component names here if any for maintainability and separation of concerns (Clean Code Principle)
    data() { /* Your initial state */ },
    methods: {
        async generateAndSave(scenarioDescription, industryType) { 
            try {
                const response = await this.$http.post('/api/v1/generate-report', scenarioDescription + ':' + industryType); // Assuming you have an HTTP client set up for Vue; replace with actual implementation:
                if (response.status !== 201) throw new Error('Failed to capture revenue');  
                return true;
            } catch (error) {
                consoles(console, 'Error in generating scenario', error); // Replace this line as necessary for localized logging with no sensitive info leaked:
                return false; 
            },
    };
}
```

This is for opportunity: Rapid Make.com Scenario Generation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
