- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file server.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
// Require necessary modules here (e.g., Neon PostgreSQL client, bcrypt for password hashing)

app.use(express.json());

const dbConfig = require('./config/db'); // Assuming a config file with database configurations including Stripe API keys and other secrets stored securely using environment variables or similar mechanisms
require('dotenv').config();
// ... rest of the server setup, routes definitions, etc. ...

This is for opportunity: AI-Powered Game Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
