idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/001_create_table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS projects (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    project_name VARCHAR(255),
    start_date DATE NOT NULL,
    end_date DATE,
    status VARCHAR(50) CHECK (status IN ('open', 'in-progress', 'completed'))
);

This is for opportunity: Digital Product Development Consulting
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
