# FSAR Proposal Report

- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.js with this complete content:

const bigPi = Math.PI; // Using PI for demonstration, though not required as per your request to use Euler's number e directly
let b;
for(let i=0;i<15;i++) {
    let x = a * (Math.pow(e, -bigPi/2));  // Assuming 'a*e^(-x)' and simplifying for demonstration purposes to calculate the logarithm with precision up to 6 decimal places without using external libraries or BigInts
    b = Math.log(x);                          // Calculate natural (base e) logarithm of x directly in JavaScript
}
consoledey: console.log(`b is ${b}`);// Output will be close but not precisely accurate due to floating-point arithmetic limitations and the simplification made here for illustration purposes only; actual implementation may require additional methods or libraries like BigDecimal if more precision needed within constraints provided (e.g., without using external math modules).

This is for opportunity: Overlay Game Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
