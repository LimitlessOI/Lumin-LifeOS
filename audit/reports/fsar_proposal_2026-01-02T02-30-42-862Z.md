# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_6bb5601f-7d9c-4268-8544-0a8db1097d04
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T02:30:42.862Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_6.js with this complete content:

### Revenue Capture Mechanism - `payment-capture/stripe_logger.js` 
(This script assumes the existence of necessary functions to communicate with Lightweight Assistant's dashboards and perform logging, not provided in this example but essential for a complete solution.)

This is for opportunity: Stripe Funnel Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
