# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_127e65be-9b20-40ab-a9ee-e7435e032004
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T01:11:47.311Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api.js with this complete content:

// ... existing code from above...
router.post('/checkout', async (req, res) => {
    // logic to handle payments using the Stripe API and store purchase data in 'purchases' table
});

This is for opportunity: Game Overlay Distribution
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
