- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.sql with this complete content:

// Mock service functions for demonstration purposes; real implementation would interact with Neon PostgreSQL or equivalent database system using ORMs like Sequelize, Prisma etc., and handle JWT tokens securely
const { uuidV4 } = require('uuid'); // UUID library to generate unique identifiers for tasks if not provided by the DB itself
// Assume necessary imports including libraries/dependencies such as pg (for PostgreSQL), Stripe, or equivalent ORMs and authentication mechanisms are already in place.

exports.createNewFreelancer = async (taskDetails) => {
  // Simplified task creation logic where 'freelancer' refers to a user who will be taking freelance opportunities; typically handled by the main DB system with proper role-based access control and relationships set up in migrations/01_create_tables.sql file mentioned below:
  
  // Insertion of new freelancer data into 'freelancers' table (simplified, assuming direct insert for example sake)
  const queryText = "INSERT INTO freelancers(name, email, skills) VALUES($1, $2, $3) RETURNING id";
  
  // Execute the PostgreSQL command with provided parameters and return new freelancer ID (if any unique identifier is generated by DB system itself in real scenarios). For this example we are using UUIDs.
  const res = await dbClient.query(queryText, [taskDetails.name, taskDetails.email, JSON.stringify(taskDetails.skills)]); // Assume 'dbClient' represents a connection to the Neon PostgreSQL database with configured role-based access control (RBAC)
  
  return res;
};

This is for opportunity: Freelance AI Assistant
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
