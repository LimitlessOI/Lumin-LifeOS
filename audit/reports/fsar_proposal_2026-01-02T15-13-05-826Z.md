- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.js with this complete content:

const stripe = require('@stripe/stripe-js')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET); // Make sure to replace this with your actual secret key or use environment variables safely! 

// ... other necessary imports and functions...

module.exports = function setupStripeConfig() {
    return stripe;
};

This is for opportunity: Stripe Integration Consultation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
