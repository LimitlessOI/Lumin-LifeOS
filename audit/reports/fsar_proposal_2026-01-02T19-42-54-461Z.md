# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_a4f172db-b0c4-4c6f-bef5-63e93839e0fe
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T19:42:54.461Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.sql with this complete content:

BEGIN;
-- Setup initial database schema for Make.com scenarios, users, executions, and financials tables with all required fields as described in the plan.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user(user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL, password_hash TEXT NOT NULL);
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS scenario (scenario_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, description TEXT, steps JSONB[], owner INTEGER REFERENCES user(user_id));
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS executions(execution_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, start_time TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, end_time TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE, status VARCHAR(50), foreign key (owner) REFERENS

This is for opportunity: Make.com Automation Scenarios
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
