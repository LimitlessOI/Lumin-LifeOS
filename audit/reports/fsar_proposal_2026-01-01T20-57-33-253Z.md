# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_97df48e4-8110-4222-826a-4cb817904dd6
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T20:57:33.253Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file controllers/developerController.js with this complete content:

const developerModel = require('../models/Developer'); // Assume this model is already defined and handles interactions with the Developers table in Neon PostgreSQL, including project-developer linking logic 
module.exports.listDevelopers = async function(req, res) { /* Implement list developers... */ };
/* ... Other controller methods for CRUD operations on Developers... */

This is for opportunity: Quick-Deploy Web Apps
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
