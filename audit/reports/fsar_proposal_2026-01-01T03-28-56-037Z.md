- id: fsar_20629bbc-fd99-458a-97b1-5645c1ddfab8
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T03:28:56.037Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_6.js with this complete content:

// File: test/workshopsTest.js (This file will contain pseudo-tests to demonstrate what they should look like)
describe('Workshop CRUD operations', () => {
    // Tests go here using Jest and Mocha frameworks, with mocked API responses for testing payments integration if needed in the future. 
});

This is for opportunity: Virtual Workshop Series for Businesses
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
