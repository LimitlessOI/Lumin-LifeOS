# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_fea19358-7551-4019-819e-dbefbe9a8d6f
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T13:13:10.648Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file config/dotenv.js with this complete content:

```javascript
require('dotenv').config();
// Load sensitive data from .env file securely into process environment variables
```

This is for opportunity: Online Business Duplication Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
