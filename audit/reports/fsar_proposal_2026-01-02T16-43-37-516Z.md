- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_4.js with this complete content:

router.get('/api/v1/overlay-analytics', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const analytics = await overlayController.getAnalytics(); // Assumes a function to calculate and return engagement metrics; see controller for details.
    return res.json(analytics);
  } catch (error) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Failed to retrieve analytics' });
  })
});

This is for opportunity: Overlay Game Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
