# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_e0ba75b4-ab3a-49bf-a307-9bf35e0c7852
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T04:14:20.492Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_5.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();

// POST endpoint to create a user account with email and password validation (email regex, etc.) - assuming Express framework for API endpoints creation in NodeJS using Sequelize ORM:
router.post('/signup', async function(req, res) {
    const errors = validateSignUpData(req.body); // Implement this according to your business logic and validation rules; modify as needed based on the actual data structure expected from `tasks` table in future migrations/changes: if using MySQL/MariaDB or PostgreSQL with Sequelize, adjust for auto-increment fields starting at 10^9.
    // User creation code here...
});

This is for opportunity: Make.com Scenario Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
