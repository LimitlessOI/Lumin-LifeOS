- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/002_create_orders_table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS orders (
    order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    product_details TEXT NOT NULL,
    quantity INTEGER CHECK (quantity > 0) DEFAULT 1,
    price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'completed'))
);

This is for opportunity: Virtual Assistant Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
