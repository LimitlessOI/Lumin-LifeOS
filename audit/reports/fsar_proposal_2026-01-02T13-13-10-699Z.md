```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// Define the schema for Business Opportunities model with ACID properties and indexing as needed
const businessOpportunitiesSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  industryType: String,
  potentialRevenue: Number,
  // Additional fields required...
});
businessOpportunitiesSchema.index({ 'industryType': 'text', 'potentialRevenue': -1 });
const BusinessOpportunitiesModel = mongoose.model('BusinessOpportunities', businessOpportunitiesSchema);
module.exports = { API: api, Model: BusinessOpportunitiesModel };
```

This is for opportunity: Online Business Duplication Service

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
