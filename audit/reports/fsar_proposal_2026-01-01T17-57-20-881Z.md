# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_a7861f65-1519-479c-a42d-6e6f85b478ef
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T17:57:20.881Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_6.js with this complete content:

import pytest
from .models import Scenario, UserInteraction  # Assuming the models are imported from appropriate modules.
# Implement various PyTest functions for testing endpoints (unit) as well as their interactions with Django Channels consumers (integration)...

This is for opportunity: Make.com Scenario Generation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
