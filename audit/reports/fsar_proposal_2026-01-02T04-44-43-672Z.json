Can you modify your Dockerfile setup so that it can handle file uploads for cloning, but ensures they don't exceed a size of 3GB? Also, optimize the API endpoint handling by implementing rate limiting and caching strategies using Redis. Integrate Sequelize ORM with PostgreSQL instead of SQLite. Make sure to include necessary configurations in your setup files and demonstrate how this would affect file uploads for cloning large SaaS applications, including a mechanism that triggers alert notifications when the size exceeds 2GB or if it fails due to network issues during transfers within our Node.js backend environment using Express.\n\n## Your task:Modify your Dockerfile setup and accompanying files with these additional requirements in mind—handling file uploads for cloning large SaaS applications without disrupting the user experience, implementing rate limiting to prevent abuse of resources during high-traffic periods, caching frequently accessed data on a Node.js backend using Redis while still ensuring scalability and efficiency, adopting Sequelize ORM with PostgreSQL instead of SQLite for database operations in ExpressJS applications, introducing alert notifications when file uploads exceed 2GB or encounter network issues during transfers within the Docker container environment—all these modifications should be demonstrated through a refactored version. Ensure that this setup can handle large files and high-demand scenarios effectively while maintaining optimal performance for end users.\n\n1. Refactor `routes/api.js` to include file upload handling with appropriate size checks, using Multer or similar middleware:\n\nThis is for opportunity: SaaS Cloning and Optimization\nMake sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.",
