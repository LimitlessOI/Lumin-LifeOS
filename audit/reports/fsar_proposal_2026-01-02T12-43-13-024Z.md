- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.sql with this complete content:

-- Assuming you have created a schema called 'code_review' in PostgreSQL and set it as default for your Rails project:
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS code_review.users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash TEXT NOT NULL, -- Store hashed passwords for security reasons
    role VARCHAR(20) CHECK (role IN ('freelancer', 'client')) NOT NULL
);

This is for opportunity: Freelancer Code Review Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
