idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/create_seo_metrics_table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE seo_metrics (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    domain VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    page_url TEXT NOT NULL,
    keyword VARCHAR(255),
    search_volume BIGINT DEFAULT 0,
    competitive_risk NUMERIC CHECK (competitive_risk >= -1 AND competitivetermic_risk <= 1)
);

This is for opportunity: AI-Powered SEO Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
