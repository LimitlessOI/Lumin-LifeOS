This logic should be built into the billing endpoints, and can include:
- A `/api/billing` endpoint to manage subscriptions or single payments. Use Stripe's provided libraries for subscription handling if applicable (e.g., `stripe_subscriptions`).
- An event listener on successful code review completion that triggers a charge via the stripe api, and logs this in Neon PostgreSQL using an ORM like Sequelize or directly with pg commands within your database interaction logic:

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
