idea_implementation: Create or update the file deployment.yml with this complete content:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata: 
    name: rapid-make-scenario-generator
spec:  
    replicas: 3 # Specify desired number here to maintain service even during deployments for scalability and reliability (increased from one)
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata: 
    name: rapid-make-scenario-generator-service
spec:  
    selector:
        app: "rapid-make" # Corrected typo in 'app' and fixed the deployment label syntax.
    ports:
      - protocol: "TCP"
          port: 80 # Port number according to service needs (correctly capitalized)
---
apiVersion: autoscaling/v1
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
    name: rapid-make-hpa
spec:  
    scaleTargetRef:
        apiVersion: apps/v1 # Specify the correct API version, as it may vary based on Kubernetes's current state.
        kind: Deployment
        name: "rapid-make" 
```

This is for opportunity: Rapid Make.com Scenario Generation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
