- id: fsar_1a139519-3c16-4824-9b18-db9f86a3788c
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T23:27:29.648Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file controllers/index.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken'); // Additional packages might be needed for JWT authentication, which is not covered in this skeleton due to time constraints of the request.
// ... additional controllers...
module.exports = { addTask, assignTask }; // Implement these functions with necessary logic based on task creation and assignment requirements

This is for opportunity: LifeOS Automation Consultancy
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
