#### Step 8 - Machine Learning for Engagement Prediction:
To create a machine learning model within Node, you would typically use an algorithm to analyze interaction logs stored in MongoDB or embedded into the database using GraphQL queries/mutations on your Express application (not directly done here due to its complexity and scope). This step is beyond simple JavaScript implementation; however, it's worth noting that this system could leverage a lightweight model like k-nearest neighbors for predictive analysis:

This is for opportunity: Personalized AI Coaching Programs
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
