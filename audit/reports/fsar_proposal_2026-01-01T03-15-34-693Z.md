- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file components/Dashboard.js with this complete content:

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, ScrollView, Button } from 'react-native'; // Assuming a list view for tasks and projects; this may vary based on actual UI requirements provided by LifeOS AI Council team members earlier.
// ... Other imports would go here as necessary... 

const Dashboard = ({ navigation }) => {
    const [projects, setProjects] = useState([]); // Initializing with an empty array or a default state based on database fetching logic implemented in API endpoints above
    
    useEffect(() => {
        // Fetch projects from the server using your defined 'fetchProject' function (not shown here) and update `setProjects` accordingly. This would typically be done within async functions to handle potential network requests or data processing asynchronously, following best practices for managing asynchronous code in React Native applications with hooks
    }, []); // Empty dependency array ensures this runs once after the initial render (similar to componentDidMount) but note that lifecycle methods are now deprecated. The equivalent functionality is achieved using 'useEffect'. 
    
    return (
        <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
            {/* A simple list view or similar UI for displaying tasks and projects */}
            <ScrollView>
                <Text>{projects[0].project_name}</Text> // Sample text rendering, actual implementation would involve mapping over the `projects` array to display relevant information about each project. 
            </ScrollView>
            
            {/* Additional components for user management and income-related functionalities can be added here as necessary */}
        </View>
    );
};

export default Dashboard; // Assuming this component is used within the main app or a navigation stack in your React Native application structure.

Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
