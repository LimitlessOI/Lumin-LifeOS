# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_80f68620-a5d8-46e6-b01d-e62533db7474
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T11:46:03.129Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
// ... complete file content with necessary endpoints, handlers...
router.get('/overlays', async function(req, res) {
    // Logic to retrieve available overlays from the database using Neon PostgreSQL driver or ORM (e.g., Sequelize)...
});
// ... more route definitions and error handling as needed...

This is for opportunity: Game Overlay Distribution Platform
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
