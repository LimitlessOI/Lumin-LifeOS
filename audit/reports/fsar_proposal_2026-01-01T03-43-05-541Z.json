Otherwise manual migration scripts would need creation as part of full deployment preparation in a live system environment like Railway (robust-magic-production.up.railway.app).\nBEGIN;\n-- Truncated for brevity, assume this is the content generated by Flask-Migrate or manually scripted if you handle migrations without extensions: CREATE TABLE market_data ... ;  -- Replace with actual SQL command to create your `market_data` table as per Neon PostgreSQL specifics.\n-- Include other necessary tables and indexes creation commands like those for user activity, analysis results etc., following best practices in schema design ensuring optimal indexing on frequently accessed columns such as timestamps or market sectors for performance enhancement during data retrieval operations which were not explicitly defined here but should be part of a complete implementation plan.\nCOMMIT;  -- Commit the changes after all necessary migrations are done to apply them in your database, typically executed via Flask-Migrate CLI command `flask db upgrade`. This is just illustrative and assumes proper setup for using SQLAlchemy with PostgreSQL on Neon.\n\nThis is for opportunity: AI-Driven Market Analysis Reports\nMake sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.",
