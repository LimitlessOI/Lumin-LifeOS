- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api/subscriptions.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();

router.post('/', async (req, res) => {
  // Create a subscription and link it to the userId in Users table
  const response = await SubscriptionService.createSubscription(req);
  return res.json(response);
});

router.get('/:userId/subscriptions', async (req, res) => {
  // List all active subscriptions tied back to the userId in Users table for a particular user
  const response = await SubscriptionService.listSubscriptionsForUser(req.params.userId);
  return res.json(response);
});

module.exports = router;

This is for opportunity: Niche Market Subscription Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
