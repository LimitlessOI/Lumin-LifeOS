- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.js with this complete content:

// file: src/components/CodeSubmissionForm.js
import React from 'react';
import { View, TextInput, Button } from 'react-native'; // Import necessary components... 

export default function CodeSubmissionForm() {
    return (
        <View style={{ flexDirection: 'column', paddingVertical: 16 }}>
            <TextInput placeholder="Coding Language" ... />
            <Button title="Upload Submission File" onPress={handleSubmit} ... /> // Implement file upload and handle submission here...  
        </View>
    );
}

This is for opportunity: Rapid Code Review Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
