# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_d0476e07-eeb3-4aeb-9fbf-315825be826c
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T13:14:08.712Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/2023_migration_create_user_accounts.sql with this complete content:

BEGIN TRANSACTION;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS UserAccount (
    UserID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    Email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    PasswordHash CHAR(64), -- Assuming bcrypt for hashing passwords
);
COMMIT;

This is for opportunity: Rapid SaaS Duplication
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
