# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_d4e3b597-1aa5-485f-ad4c-84fedee524d4
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T14:42:58.479Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file api/routes/auth.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();

// User registration endpoint using Stripe for payment handling if necessary
router.post('/register', async (req, res) => {
  // Implement user sign-up logic here...
});

module.exports = router;

This is for opportunity: Rapid Code Review Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
