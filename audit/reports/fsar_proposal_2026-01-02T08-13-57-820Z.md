idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_4.js with this complete content:

// file: src/components/ReviewStatus.js
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native'; // Import necessary components... 

export default function ReviewStatus({ submissionId }) {
    return (
        <View style={{ paddingVertical: 16 }}>
            <Text>Review Status for Submission ID:</Text>
            <Text>{submissionStatus}</Text> // Display the status of a specific code review here...  
        </View>    
    );
}

This is for opportunity: Rapid Code Review Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
