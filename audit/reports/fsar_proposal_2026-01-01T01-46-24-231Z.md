- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file api/routes/index.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express'); const router = new express.Router(); // Define API routes for user registration, products retrieval, and order creationrouter.post('/auth-token', async (req, res) => { /* POST route to handle authentication token generation */ });router.get('/products', async (req, res) => { /* GET route to list all available products */ });router.post('/order-create/:userId', async (req, res) => { /* Handle the creation of an order after user signup and product selection*/});

This is for opportunity: E-commerce Chatbot Integration
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
