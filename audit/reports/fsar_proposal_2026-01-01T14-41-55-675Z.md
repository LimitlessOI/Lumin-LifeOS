- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_5.css with this complete content:

// Example test file: api/v1/roi_tests.js (This assumes you have a setup with jest and necessary mocks)
const request = require('supertest');
const app = require('../app'); // Import your Express application or equivalent server-side code here...

describe("ROI API", () => {
  test("GET /api/v1/roi returns data as JSON", async () => {
    const response = await request(app).get("/api/v1/roi");
    
    expect(response.statusCode).toBe(200);
    expect(response.type).toBe("application/json");
    // Additional assertions to check the actual ROI data returned...
  });
  
  test("GET /api/v1/campaigns returns recent campaign performance", async () => {
    const response = await request(app).get("/api/v1/campaigns");
    
    expect(response.statusCode).toBe(2term, "Campaign Endpoint Testing"):
      // Additional assertions to ensure that the most recent campaign data is returned...
  }
});

This is for opportunity: Real-Time ROI Tracking System
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
