- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api/offer.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
const { prisma } = require('../db'); -- As with user registration endpoint, ensuring correct alias and path adjustments to fit project structure (e.g., './models'). Adjust imports accordingly:
router.post('/create', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const offer = await prisma.offer.create({ data: req.body }); -- Similar approach for creating offers with proper Prisma client methods and request body structure as per model definitions which should include an `status` field to reflect the current state of the offered funnel step, adjusted based on actual application requirements such as user feedback mechanisms influencing offer status transitions:
    res.json(offer); -- Responding with created offer instance and potentially including additional information relevant for UX/UI interactions within frontend components not shown herein due to focus scope limitation but should include necessary data structured appropriately (e.g., JSON objects representing nested offers if applicable):
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating new offer', error); -- Error handling for offering creation process, which may involve detailed feedback mechanisms based on actual Prisma client exception types or custom logic encapsulated within the application's UX/UI design considerations:
    res.status(400).send(error.message || 'Offer creation failed'); -- Standardized response for registration process errors, adjusted to reflect specific needs based on actual database schema and business requirements not detailed herein due to scope limitation but should provide appropriate user feedback mechanisms within frontend components:
  }
});

This is for opportunity: Quick Start Online Income Funnels
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
