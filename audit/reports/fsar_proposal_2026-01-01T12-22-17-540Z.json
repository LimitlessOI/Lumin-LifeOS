  "proposal": "self_improvement:  To address the issues identified, we need to focus on several key areas:\n\n1. **Resolving Data Schema Issues**: The primary issue is with the database schema not recognizing the `ai_model` column in the `execution_tasks` table. This can be resolved by either creating or renaming this column to match the existing schema definition.\n   - **Actionable Improvement**: Verify and correct the schema for the `execution_tasks` table by running a migration script that adds the missing `ai_model` column if it's not present, or rename an existing column if there was a mistake in naming.\n\n2. **Optimizing Performance Metrics**: The performance bottlenecks identified are vague and need more specific details for actionable improvements. However, based on the types listed (implement_idea, idea_implementation, self_improvement), it seems like we need to focus on improving efficiency in conceptualizing ideas, implementing them, and continuously enhancing the system itself.\n   - **Actionable Improvement**: Implement a performance monitoring tool that can provide detailed insights into query times, memory usage, and other runtime metrics. This will help identify specific bottlenecks more effectively. Additionally, consider optimizing database queries to reduce unnecessary operations and improve response times.\n\n3. **Enhancing Monetization Flows**: With the focus on reducing friction in monetization flows, improving ROI visibility, and maintaining safety and ethics, we need to ensure that all transactions are transparent and secure. This includes integrating with Stripe for better revenue tracking without compromising user data or security.\n   - **Actionable Improvement**: Review and optimize the integration with Stripe to ensure seamless logging of financial transactions. Implement additional checks for fraud and unauthorized usage. Consider implementing a real-time dashboard in our system that shows detailed ROI snapshots, allowing for quicker decision-making based on current performance metrics.\n\n4. **Addressing Blind Spots**: The detection of 7349 blind spots suggests areas where data is not being captured or utilized effectively. This could be due to incomplete data collection processes or inefficient algorithms in processing the collected data.\n   - **Actionable Improvement**: Audit and update data collection protocols to ensure all relevant interactions, transactions, and user behaviors are logged. Train our AI models on more diverse datasets to improve their ability to recognize patterns that were previously missed (blind spots).\n\nBy focusing on these specific improvements, we can not only resolve the immediate issues but also enhance the overall robustness and efficiency of our system.",
