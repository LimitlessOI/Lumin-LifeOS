- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_4.js with this complete content:

### Stripe Charge Integration ###
*Optional but not mandatory as per the plan.* (Note: This code will integrate with an external API, so it should be developed after setting up secure authentication and handling sensitive data.)

This is for opportunity: E-commerce Conversion Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
