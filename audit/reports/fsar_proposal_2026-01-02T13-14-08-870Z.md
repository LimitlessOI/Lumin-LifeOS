- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/2023_migration_create_offers.sql with this complete content:

BEGIN TRANSACTION;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Offers (
    OfferID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    Title VARCHAR(100),
    Description TEXT,
    PricePoint DECIMAL(10, 2), -- assuming price can have cents e.g., $99.99 for two decimal places precision and up to a max value of double-digit thousands (to avoid overflows)
    Duration VARCHAR(30), -- Representing the duration as 'Xd' where X is days, eg: "7d" or using proper date fields would be more efficient in production but complies with given instructions.
    CONSTRAINT unique_offer UNIQUE (Title, PricePoint)
);
COMMIT;

This is for opportunity: Rapid SaaS Duplication
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
