idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/002_create_marketing_campaigns.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS marketing_campaigns (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
  start_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
  end_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
  createdAt TIMESTAMP WITH TIMEZONE DEFAULT CURRENT0.railwayapp-local/systems/campaigns/marketing_fun.json

This is for opportunity: Automated Marketing Funnel Creation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
