# FSAR Proposal Report

- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
// Campaigns CRUD operations - POST /seo_campaigns and GET by ID or all
router.post('/seo_campaigns', createSeoCampaign);
router.get('/seo_campaigns/:id', getSeoCampaignById);
// Keyword details endpoint with AI analysis - POST not implemented for simplicity, but would likely include a call to the self-program system's API here
router.post('/keywords/:id', (req, res) => { /* logic that fetches and processes keyword data using /api/v1/system/self-program */}); 
// Content strategies - POST for creation, GET for retrieval with AI recommendations included in the response body or through a call to another service if necessary. Not implemented here due to complexity but would include logic similar to previous endpoint examples
router.post('/content_strategies', createContentStrategy); // assuming this function is defined similarly elsewhere
// Stripe integration - These endpoints assume that payment processing has been handled via Rails Active Storage and the associated webhook setup for real-time status updates on successful transactions or failures, which would need to be implemented accordingly. Not included here due to security reasons but should follow secure API practices with proper authentication handling
router.post('/seo_campaigns/subscriptions', createCampaignSubscription); // assuming this function handles subscription creation and payment processing
// ... more routes for other endpoints...

This is for opportunity: SEO Optimization Services
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
