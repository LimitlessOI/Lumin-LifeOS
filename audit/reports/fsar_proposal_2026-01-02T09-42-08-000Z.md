idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.sql with this complete content:

-- File: migrations/001_create_table.sql ===START FILE===
BEGIN TRANSA023456G;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    role TEXT CHECK(role IN ('student', 'teacher'))
);
-- Users with different roles can be added here...
COMMIT;
===END FILE===

This is for opportunity: Online Course Creation for Tech Skills
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
