idea_implementation: Create or update the file config/kubernetes-deployment.yaml with this complete content:

{
    "apiVersion": "apps/v1",
    "kind": "Deployment",
    "metadata": {
        "name": "learning-platform"
    },
    // ... more configuration details for Kubernetes deployment... 
}

This is for opportunity: Personalized Learning Platforms
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
