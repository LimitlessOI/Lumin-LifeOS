idea_implementation: Create or update the file database/migrations/2023_04_15_init_users_table.sql with this complete content:

BEGIN TRANSACTION;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    encrypted_password TEXT NOT NULL,
    preferences JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::JSONB
);
CREATE INDEX ON users (email);
COMMIT;

This is for opportunity: Personalized Learning Systems
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
