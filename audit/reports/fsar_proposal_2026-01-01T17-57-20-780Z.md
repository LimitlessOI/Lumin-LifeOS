- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_4.html with this complete content:

import React from 'react';
import { Line } from 'd3-line'; // Assuming d3-v5 or later for line chart creation. If using an older version of D3JS: import * as d3 from 'd3'; 
import ChartContainer from './ChartContainer';
import StripePaymentForm from './StripePaymentForm'; // This would be a custom form we create to handle the payment process through our Django backend.

function App() {
    return (
        <div className="App">
            <h1>Make.com Scenario Dashboard</h1>
            <StripePaymentForm />
            <ChartContainer scenarios={this.state.scenarios} />  // This would be a function that renders chart components dynamically based on the state of `scenarios`.
        </div>
    );
}
export default App;

This is for opportunity: Make.com Scenario Generation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
