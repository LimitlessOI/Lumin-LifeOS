- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.sql with this complete content:

-- migrations/001_create_tables.sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED; -- To avoid dirty reads and non-repeatable read issues in a multi-user environment 

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
    ... other user fields...
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS courses (
    course_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    content JSONB CHECK (content->>'type' IN ('text', 'video', 'quiz')), -- Ensure only accepted types are inserted for dynamic field flexibility. 
    ... other course fields...
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS enrollments (
    user_id INT REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    course_id INT REFERENCES courses(course_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(), -- Captures the time of enrollment. 
    ... other relevant fields...
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS payments (
    transaction_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    course_id INT REFERENCES courses(course_id) ON DELETE SET NULL -- Optional for soft deletion of payment records. 
);

-- Other necessary migrations like creating indexes go here...

COMMIT;

Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
