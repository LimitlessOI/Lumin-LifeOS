- id: fsar_c7e41bd1-0306-49af-9f54-6f42d4b85c39
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T01:47:21.958Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/001_create_businesses_table.sql with this complete content:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS businesses (
    business_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    industry VARCHAR(255),
    description TEXT
);
```

This is for opportunity: Instant Business Duplication
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
