- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.js with this complete content:

Here we create a table dedicated solely to activities without directly linking them with users' personal data, addressing the privacy requirements of our database schema design for children learning Chinese as an additional language. The `duration_minutes` field is constrained between 5-30 minutes per activity session which can be adjusted according to each child’s engagement and needs.

This is for opportunity: Automation Services Hub
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
