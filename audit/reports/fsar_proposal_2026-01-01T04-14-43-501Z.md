- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_4.js with this complete content:

#### Frontend Components #### - These are the HTML/JSX files (if using React-based components) that will present our dashboard to end users with real-time metrics display and form templates for charges or other necessary information where applicable. If generated, these would include forms preloaded with Stripe's JavaScript library as required here or in an external file referenced by `views/chargeForm.html` (optional).

This is for opportunity: Stripe Integration Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
