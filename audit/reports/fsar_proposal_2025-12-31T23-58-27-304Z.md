- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.sql with this complete content:

// File: api/routes/api.js
const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
const lightweightAssistant = require('../controllers/lightweight_assistant'); // Assumed controller for the AI system
router.get('/customer-data', lightweightAssistant.getCustomerData);
router.post('/self-program', lightweightAssistant.selfProgramStart);
router.get('/revenue-capture', require('./chargeback').processChargeBack, express.json()); // Assuming chargeback module is responsible for handling chargebacks and revenue capture logic.
router.put('/customer/update/:id', require('./lead_scoring').scoreLead);
module.exports = router;

This is for opportunity: Rapid SaaS Cloning
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
