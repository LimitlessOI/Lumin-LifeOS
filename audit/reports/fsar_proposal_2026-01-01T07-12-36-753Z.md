# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_d657170d-0b3c-4fec-8016-730812ffdeb6
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T07:12:36.753Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file tests/paymentsControllerTest.js with this complete content:

// Setup your testing environment, stubbing out dependencies with jest.mock() or similar libraries if needed 
describe('Payment Endpoint', () => {
    test('Creates a payment successfully', async () => {
        // Test code here...
    });
});

This is for opportunity: Subscription-Based Code Snippets Library
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
