- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_5.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const { validateToken, getPlayerMetrics } = require('../utils/authMiddleware');
const router = express.Router();
router.get('/:gamedb_id/metrics', validateToken, async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const playerMetrics = await getPlayerMetrics(req.params.gamedb_id);
        res.json(playerMetrics);
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(401).send('Unauthorized'); // Implement your custom error handling here based on 'validateToken' logic.
    }
});
module.exports = router;

This is for opportunity: AI Overlay for Game Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
