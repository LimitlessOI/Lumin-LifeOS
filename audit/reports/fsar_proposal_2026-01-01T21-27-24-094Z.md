- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file config/k8s_deployment.yml with this complete content:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: checkout-service
spec:
  replicas: 3 # Number of instances to maintain for load balancing and high availability, adjust according to expected traffic volumes after testing in Railway’s platform.  
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: checkout-service
  strategy:
    type: Recreate # or DeploymentType on Railway's CLI if available, alternatively specify other strategies like 'Recreate' for full rolling updates when changing deployments as needed post self-programming endpoint setup.  
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: checkout-service
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: checkout-container
        image: your-docker-image:latest # Replace with actual Docker container images used for payment processing, user management and analytics reporting services.  
        ports:
          - containerPort: 8080 # Default HTTP port to expose the Express app on; adjust as necessary based on needs of frontend applications hosted elsewhere (e.g., Railway's backend capabilities).  
        envFrom:
          - secretRef: stripe-secrets # Reference Stripe secrets from Kubernetes Secrets, ensure these are set up securely and not embedded in code for production use as per best practices to keep sensitive information safe (e.g., Railway's backend capabilities).  
      volumes:
        persistentVolumeClaim: your-claim  # Replace with the actual name of Persistent Volume Claim tied to Neon PostgreSQL database, ensure this is set up and provisioned for data persistence across pod restarts or redeployments.
```

This is for opportunity: Stripe Funnel Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
