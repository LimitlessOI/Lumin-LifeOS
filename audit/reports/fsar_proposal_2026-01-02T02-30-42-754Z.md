# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_fbe1aaf8-75bf-44bb-a408-64e16b4f6d99
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T02:30:42.754Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_4.js with this complete content:

### Frontend Components - `frontend/checkout-page.js` (if frontend logic is required) and associated HTML files for a clean checkout experience are assumed as necessary components based on design guidelines; these would include forms, progress bars or any other interactive elements that guide users through the payment process seamlessly with Stripe's integration in mind using LiveChat support widget.

This is for opportunity: Stripe Funnel Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
