- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.js with this complete content:

Given the constraints and details provided about implementing Make.com Automation Scenarios with Phi-3 Mini AI System within LifeOS Council:

1. **Database Schema Setup** - Execute SQL migrations to set up necessary tables in Neon PostgreSQL for scenarios, clients, and a junction table if needed (client_scenario). This ensures relationships are properly maintained between different entities like client needs & their corresponding scenarios without immediate Stripe integration.

2. **API Endpoints** - Implement Express.js routes to handle CRUD operations on the scenario data:

This is for opportunity: Make.com Automation Scenarios
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
