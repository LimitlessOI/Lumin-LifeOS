- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.html with this complete content:

import React, { useState, useEffect, useReducer } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

const createTemplate = async () => {
    const templateData = new Formik({ initialValues: {}, onSubmit }); // Placeholder for form data structure and validation logic.
    
    return (
        <div>
            <form id="templateCreator">
                <input type="text" name="title" placeholder="Template Name"/>
                {/* Add more fields as necessary */}
                
                <button onClick={handleSubmit}>Create Template</button>
            end of form;
        </div>
    );
};

This is for opportunity: Code Generation Templates
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
