# E-commerce Chatbot Integration Project\nThis project integrates a chatbot with an e-commerce platform using Node.js, Express, Neo4j for graph database and Docker to containerize the application.\n## Dependencies:\n1. nodemon - Runs your server in development mode allowing you to see results of changes made without stopping servers manually\n2. dotenv - Loads environment variables from .env file into process.env
3. body-parser, cors - Express middleware for parsing incoming request bodies and handling Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) respectively.\n## Environment Variables:\ndefault values provided are suitable for local development\n* `DATABASE_URL` default to Neo4j running on localhost with a custom password if set. Otherwise, it will connect using standard credentials without encryption unless specified in `.env.local`. \nDatabase schema files (SQL) and other dependencies should be created as per the plan provided above.\n## Running Environment Variables:\ndocker-compose up -d to run services\nyou can override environment variables such as `DATABASE_URL` using command line arguments or by editing `.env.local`.

This is for opportunity: E-commerce Chatbot Integration
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
