CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS payments (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    amount NUMERIC(19, 4) CHECK ($amount >= 0),
    currency VARCHAR(5) DEFAULT 'USD',
    reference UUID NOT NULL UNIQUE, -- Assuming we're using pgcrypto extension for uuid generation.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
