- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file Dockerfile-chatbot with this complete content:

# Dockerfile content to containerize chatbot service using Node.js, Express, MongoDB/Neon PostgreSQL as the database and NLP model integration via a Python Flask microservice for GPT-3 API calls (if necessary) or Rasa deployment within this environment goes here...

===FILE:migrations/create_tables.sql===
-- SQL migrations to create required tables in Neon PostgreSQL, including `inquiries`, `tickets`, etc. as specified above ... 

===FILE:routes/api-v1/customer-support/index.js===
const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
// POST endpoint to create inquiries and tickets, including file upload for images if necessary...
router.post('/', async (req, res) => { /* logic implementation */ });
// ... additional endpoints based on the provided plan go here ... 
module.exports = router;

This is for opportunity: AI-Powered Customer Support Chatbots
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
