- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file components/RevenueDisplay.js with this complete content:

import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react'; // Assume other imports are necessary for real-time updates and global state management (omitted here) 
const RevenueDisplay = ({ revenueData }) => {
    const [revenueStatus, setRevenueStatus] = useState('Loading...');
    
    useEffect(() => {
        // Fetch initial data from API endpoint /api/v1/revenue and update state accordingly. Assume this function is implemented elsewhere in the codebase 
        fetch('/api/v1/revenue')
            .then(response => response.json())
            .then(data => setRevenueStatus(data))
    }, []); // Call it once when component mounts
    
    return (
      <div>Total Revenue: {revenueData ? revenueData : 'Loading...'}</div> 
    );
};
export default RevenueDisplay;

This is for opportunity: Stripe Integration Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
