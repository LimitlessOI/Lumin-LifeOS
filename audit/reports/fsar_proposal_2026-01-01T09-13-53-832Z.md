- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_7.css with this complete content:

// Assume that we have already defined models at './models/' path accordingly 
const knex = require('knex');
require('dotenv').config();

let dbConfig = {
    client: 'mssql', // Assuming SQL Server, but this can be changed to PostgreSQL/Neon as required. Adjust according to your actual setup and database driver chosen for use with MongoDB or Neon DB technology stack if different from standard Node.js packages. 
    connection: process.env.DATABASE_URL || 'your-database', // Replace this placeholder value accordingly, typically using the PSQL_DB variable defined in environment configs.  
};
// ... Knex and migration code to handle database migrations...

This is for opportunity: AI-Driven User Behavior Analysis
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
