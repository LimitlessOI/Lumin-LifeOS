- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file config.json with this complete content:

{
  "database_name": "workflows",
  "host": "your-db-connection-string-here" // Replace with your actual database connection string or config file path if needed
}

This is for opportunity: Make.com Automation Scenarios
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
