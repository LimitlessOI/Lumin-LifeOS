The goal is to create this Makecom dashboard using React Native on Railway's robust platform infrastructure, which includes backend services written in Python. Your task involves several steps:\n\nFirstly, rewrite and expand upon the provided document with detailed instructions for setting up a complete Express API service that integrates Stripe payments securely within Rails (a Ruby on Rails framework). This should include configuring environment variables safely to store sensitive data like secret keys without exposing them in plain text. Then proceed by adding comprehensive security measures, including implementing JWT authentication and ensuring compliance with GAAP/IFRS revenue recognition standards while using Neon ORM for database interactions within the Rails framework on Railway's robust platform infrastructure only as part of railway system specifications in LifeOS AI Council’softhe initial document. The backend should also establish a secure WebSocket connection utilizing TLS encryption between React Native and Railways services to enable real-time data synchronization, adhering strictly to the security protocol specified by Railway's infrastructure guidelines. Lastly, ensure that all user inputs for financial transactions are properly sanitized using Rails built-in mechanisms before processing payments via Stripe APIs while handling possible exceptions and errors robustly in your code example.\n\nDocument:\n\nThis is for opportunity: Make.com Scenario Creation\nMake sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.",
