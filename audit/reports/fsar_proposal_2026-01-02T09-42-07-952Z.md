idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.js with this complete content:

// File: routes/api.js ===START FILE===
const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();

router.post('/auth/register', async (req, res) => {
    // Code to handle user registration...
});

router.post('/auth/login', async (req, res) => {
    // Code to handle user login and JWT token generation...
});

router.get('/courses', async (req, res) => {
    // Code to list available courses using Stripe API for pricing information if needed...
});

// Other necessary routes like /api/auth/login/{token} for session handling and so on can be added here as well.

module.exports = router;
===END FILE===

This is for opportunity: Online Course Creation for Tech Skills
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
