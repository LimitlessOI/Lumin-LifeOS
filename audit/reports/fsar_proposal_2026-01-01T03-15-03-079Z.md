idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.sql with this complete content:

// routes/api.js - Express.js API Endpoints
const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
const { exec } = require("child_process");

router.get('/tasks', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        // Implement queue retrieval logic here using Railway's tools or a separate service like RabbitMQ/Kafka if needed for real-time updates to the creator dashboard.
        
        const tasks = await getTasksFromQueue();  // This is an async placeholder function that should fetch task data from your system, potentially involving database queries and processing using Lightweight Assistant's capabilities.
        res.json(tasks);
    } catch (error) {
        console0res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
    }
});

router.post('/tasks', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        // Implement task queuing logic here using Lightweight Assistant's execution capabilities to prioritize based on urgency and creator availability.
        
        await queueTask(req.body);  // This is an async placeholder function that should add a new task into the system, potentially involving database queries and processing related tasks priority as per Railway’s tools or another queuing service if necessary.
        res.status(201).send('Task added to the queue');
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
    }}
);

router.post('/revenue', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        // Implement revenue capture logic here including Stripe integration as needed based on Step 8 of the plan if chosen for implementation. This should include error handling and logging to Neon PostgreSQL database schema designed earlier in step 2 with appropriate indexing strategies. Use environment variables or Railway's API secrets management tool like Rails Secret Manager where required, ensuring secure data transfers using HTTPS only as per the plan’s security protocol requirements.
        
        await captureRevenue(req.body);  // This is an async placeholder function that should handle Stripe payment if integrated and log in Neon PostgreSQL database schema designed earlier with proper indexing strategies to optimize performance based on Lightweight Assistant's simple_analysis capabilities as per Railway’s robust-magic production environment setup.
        res.status(201).send('Revenue captured');
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
}}}

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
