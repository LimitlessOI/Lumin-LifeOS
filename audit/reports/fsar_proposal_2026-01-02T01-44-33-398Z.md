idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_4.sql with this complete content:

This structure respectfully separates the user information from learning content, while also ensuring that children can access appropriate activities based on their age group and skill level (not directly linked to personal identity). 

To address transactional consistency during updates of completion statuses or activity details:
- Use `SERIALIZABLE` isolation levels for transactions involving user progress data. This will ensure atomicity, maintaining a consistent state within the database even in concurrent access scenarios (e.g., simultaneous edits to records by different users). SQLAlchemy supports this level of transaction control and can handle such operations seamlessly when used with appropriate connection parameters:

This is for opportunity: Automation Services Hub
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
