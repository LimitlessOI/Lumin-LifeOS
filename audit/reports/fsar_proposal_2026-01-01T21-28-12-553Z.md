- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file terraform/main.tf with this complete content:

provider "aws" {
  region = var.region # Assume this is defined somewhere in the variables file or environment variables
}

resource "aws_iam_user" "default" {}

resource "aws_security_group" "api_sg" {
  name        = "api-access-SG"
  description = "Allow access to API endpoints for internal services only."
  
  ingress {
    from_port       = var.from_port # Assume this is defined elsewhere in the configuration file or environment variables
    protocol        = 'TCP'
    to_port          = var.to_port # Same as above
    cidr_blocks      = ["0.0.0.0/0"] // Allowing all IP addresses, replace with a more restrictive CIDR block in production for security reasons 
  }
}

resource "aws_autoscaling_group" "api_asg" {
  name        = var.name # Assume this is defined elsewhere as 'API-ASG' or similar naming convention
  launchConfigurationId    = aws_launch_configuration.this.id # Assuming an IAM role and security group are already configured for the EC2 instances (omitted here)
  min_size     = var.min_instance_count
  max_size      = var.max_instance_count
  
  vpc_zone_identifier {
    allUsers = true # Adjust according to actual requirements - whether this is accessible from the outside and needs VPC access (omitted here)
  }
}

output "api_endpoint" {
  value = aws_alb.this.dns_name // Assume ALB name 'my-api-lb' configured with HTTP/2 support for gRPC or WebSockets as necessary 
}

This is for opportunity: Stripe Integration Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
