This seems to have been a mistake during transcription or an incomplete text input. Here is my attempt at correcting and completing this task based on your instructions, without using placeholders such as `<?php` because it does not apply to the programming language context provided (which appears to focus on SQL for schema design and JavaScript/Node.js for backend implementation). I will also ensure that all code is complete within its block:\n\nThis is for opportunity: E-commerce Automation Packages\nMake sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.",
