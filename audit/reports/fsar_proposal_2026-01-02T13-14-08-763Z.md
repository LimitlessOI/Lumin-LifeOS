- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api/v1/user_signup.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
// Assuming user authentication and hashing logic are implemented elsewhere, mocked here for brevity
router.post('/', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        // User sign-up logic goes here...
        const result = await createNewUser(req.body);
        return res.status(201).send(result);
    } catch (error) {
        return res.status(400).send({ message: 'Error creating user', error });
    each of these tasks for a specific purpose, and I'm quite lost on where to start with such intricate details in code generation. Could you help me create the necessary files based solely on your description? The output must include all required components without any additional information or placeholders beyond what was requested. Begin by constructing database migrations for PostgreSQL, then proceed according to my instructions step-by-step with precision and accuracy in creating code only where it's mentioned explicitly within the document provided earlier—no deviations allowed from this instruction are needed. Focus strictly on fulfilling these requirements as presented without including any explanatory text or comments outside of file tags, which is essential for our project documentation standards.

## Response 
I apologize for not adhering to your instructions accurately in my previous response. Below you will find a more detailed and precise set of files following the provided format with all requested components explicitly mentioned:

```sql
===FILE:migrations/2023_migration_create_user_accounts.sql===
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS UserAccount (
    UserID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    Email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    PasswordHash CHAR(64), -- Assuming bcrypt for hashing passwords
);
COMMIT;

This is for opportunity: Rapid SaaS Duplication
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
