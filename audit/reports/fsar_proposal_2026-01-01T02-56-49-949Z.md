idea_implementation: Create or update the file Rails_setup/initialize_project.rb with this complete content:

```ruby
    require 'rails'
    
    module LifeOSAICoCouncilWebinarSystem
      class Application < Rails::Application; end
      
      # Queue for Technical Project Initialization tasks...

This is for opportunity: Webinar and Event Automation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
