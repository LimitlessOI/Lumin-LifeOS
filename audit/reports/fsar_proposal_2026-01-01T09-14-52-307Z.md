# FSAR Proposal Report

- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.sql with this complete content:

-- Seed Initial Dataset (Separate script file)
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO services(title, price) VALUES ('First Service', '25.00');
INSERT INTO users(name, email, encrypted_password) SELECT * FROM generate_series(1, 3); -- for simplicity assuming we're creating three test users with unique emails and simple passwords that are then bcrypt-hashed in the UserService create method (not shown here)...
-- Repeat INSERT INTO statements as needed to seed initial data. Assume `UserService` is a custom service handling database interactions: 
COMMIT;

This is for opportunity: Self-programming System
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
