  "proposal": "self_improvement:  To address the issues identified, we should focus on several key areas to improve the system's performance and functionality:\n\n1. **Fixing Database Schema Issues**: The primary issue seems to be with the database schema related to `ai_model` in the `execution_tasks` table. This is causing task execution failures due to a missing column. We need to update the schema to include this column. Here's how we can handle it:\n   - Update the PostgreSQL database schema by adding the `ai_model` column if it does not exist.\n   - Ensure that the migration script is robust and tested before applying it to production.\n\n2. **Performance Optimization**: The performance bottlenecks identified are primarily in self-improvement and idea implementation tasks, with average durations significantly high compared to other tasks. We need to optimize these processes:\n   - Implement a more efficient algorithm or method for self-improvement tasks that can handle large datasets without excessive processing time.\n   - Review and refactor the codebase for `idea_implementation` tasks to reduce unnecessary computations and improve efficiency.\n\n3. **Reducing Friction in Monetization Flows**: To enhance ROI visibility and ensure ethical handling of monetization flows, we should:\n   - Implement real-time tracking and reporting for all income streams, including detailed analytics on how Stripe integration impacts revenue.\n   - Introduce user feedback mechanisms to gauge customer satisfaction and adjust offerings accordingly, ensuring that our actions align with safety and ethics standards.\n\n4. **Updating Infrastructure**: Given the live system running on Railway, it's crucial to maintain optimal performance:\n   - Regularly monitor infrastructure metrics such as CPU usage, memory allocation, and network traffic to identify potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies.\n   - Optimize database queries for better performance and scalability.\n\n5. **Enhancing Safety and Ethics**: As a critical aspect of our operations, we must:\n   - Regularly audit AI models used in tasks to ensure compliance with ethical guidelines and safety standards set by the council.\n   - Implement strict data handling practices that protect user privacy and comply with legal requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).\n\n**Specific Actions**:\n- **Database Migration:** Write a migration script for `execution_tasks` table to add `ai_model` column if it's missing. Ensure this is applied through version control and tested in staging before deployment.\n   ```sql\n   ALTER TABLE execution_tasks ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS ai_model TEXT;\n   ```\n- **Performance Optimization Scripts:** Develop scripts that focus on optimizing the self-improvement tasks using more efficient algorithms, possibly leveraging GPU or cloud services for heavy computations.\n- **Real-Time Reporting Tool:** Integrate a real-time reporting dashboard using Stripe API to visualize income streams and user engagement metrics effectively.\n- **Feedback Mechanism:** Implement a simple survey or feedback system integrated within the application that users can access after each task completion, capturing their experience directly.\n- **Regular Audits:** Schedule routine audits of all AI models in use to ensure they are up-to-date with the latest safety and ethical standards.\n\nBy focusing on these specific improvements, we can address the immediate issues while laying a foundation for future enhancements that will improve our system's robustness, efficiency, and user satisfaction.",
