idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.css with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
const stripe = require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY);
require('dotenv').config();

router.get('/', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const subscriptionPayments = await stripe.subscriptionScheds.list({});
        let snapshots;
        // Logic to generate revenue snapshot from subscription payments data
        // This is a placeholder and the actual implementation will depend on how you store your transaction details in Neon PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchbot or similar ORM tooling. 
        
        res.json({ snapshots: snapshots });
    } catch (err) {
        console.error(err);
        res.status(500).send('An error occurred');
    }
});

module.exports = router;

This is for opportunity: AI-Driven Business Consultancy
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
