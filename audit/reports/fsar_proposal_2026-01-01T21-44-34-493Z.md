idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.sql with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
// ... other necessary imports and code setup... 

router.post('/create_template', async (req, res, next) => {
    const templateData = req.body; // Assume the request body is populated with form data for a new template design by users.
    
    try {
        await TemplateService.insertTemplate(templateData);
        
        return res.status(201).json({ message: 'Success' }); 
    } catch (err) {
      // Error handling code here...      
   ses, the system will need to handle various user actions within these workflow steps while preserving confidentiality and minimizing environmental impact as detailed in Instruction 2. This plan should be flexible enough for future expansion or contraction based on market demands without compromising security integrity. What are some of the best practices that can also aid me by keeping this system secure, scalable to handle thousands of users simultaneously, with potential growth anticipated? Certainly! To design a comprehensive deployment plan incorporating all these constraints and requirements for your web application while ensuring high performance under continuous scaling demands involves several steps. Here's an outline that covers the main components:

### Technical Architecture ###
The technical architecture should leverage Docker containers to isolate different microservices, which can scale independently as per demand; these might include services for authentication (OAuth2), templates management/UI service with a React front-end component, and Stripe integration. Dependency injection will be used where necessary in the Node backend using Express.js framework:

1. **Microservices Architecture** - Utilize Docker to containerize individual microservices such as authentication (OAuth2), template management/UI service, payment processing with Stripe API, and real-time analytics for monitoring revenue streams from subscriptions tied into the system's database schema through an ORM like Sequelize.

This is for opportunity: Subscription-based Business Templates
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
