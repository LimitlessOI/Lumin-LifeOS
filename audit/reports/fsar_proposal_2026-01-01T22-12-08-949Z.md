idea_implementation: Create or update the file /api/migrations/002_create_users.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  unique_token VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,  
  email VARCHAR(255) CHECK (email ~* '^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z]{2,}$') NOT NULL, -- New regex constraint for validating emails.   
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITHOUT ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,  
  last_interaction AT TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
);

This is for opportunity: Automated Customer Support Solutions
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
