idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/001_create_users_table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
    phone_number VARCHAR(20),
    service_subscription BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    stripeToken CHAR(48) -- Assuming Stripe token size of 48 characters for simplicity. Adjust as needed based on actual data requirements and after confirming with Stripe's API documentation if integrated into this project.
);

This is for opportunity: On-Demand Tech Support
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
