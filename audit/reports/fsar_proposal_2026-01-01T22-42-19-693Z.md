- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file db/migrate/2023_10_05_create_seo_campaigns.sql with this complete content:

BEGIN TRANSA_START;
-- Assume we're in a live system, this script would start and rollback transactions upon encountering errors for safety reasons. This code is simplified to focus on the SQL command itself:
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS seo_campaigns (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    client_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    start_date DATE NOT NULL
);
CREATE INDEX ON seo_campaigns (client_name);
-- ... more SQL to create other tables and relationships if needed...
COMMIT TRANSA_START;

This is for opportunity: SEO Optimization Services
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
