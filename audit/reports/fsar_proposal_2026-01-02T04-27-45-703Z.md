# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_0288ec07-f981-4cb4-bdee-7e8c44447542
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T04:27:45.703Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file tests/userController_spec.js with this complete content:

const chai = require('chai'); 
const expect = chai.expect; // Or if you're implementing this as a TypeScript project, use the appropriate type assertion from 'chai-as-promised'.
// Assuming userController is your implementation of authentication related logic:
describe("User Controller", function() {
    describe("authenticate endpoint", function() { 
        // Write tests here to verify that users are authenticated correctly. For example, mock the OAuth2 response and test various scenarios such as successful login/signup, handling incorrect credentials etc., ensuring sensitive data like passwords is not exposed in these examples:
    });  
});

This is for opportunity: Game Development Overlay Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
