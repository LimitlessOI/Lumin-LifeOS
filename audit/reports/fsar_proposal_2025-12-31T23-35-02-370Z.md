# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_f4683e87-1e32-4c30-8327-9ab1a7531b95

- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
const stripe = require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET); // Ensure this is set in environment variables for security
// ... other necessary imports ...
router.get('/api/v1/overlays', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const overlays = await getOverlays(); // Implement the function to retrieve overlay data from Neon PostgreSQL database
        res.json(overlays);
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).send('Server Error');
    }
});
// ... other necessary API endpoints, including POST for `/api/v1/income` and self-programming endpoint...

This is for opportunity: Game Development for Overlay Distribution
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
