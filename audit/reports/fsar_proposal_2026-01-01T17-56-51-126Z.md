idea_implementation: Create or update the file config/database.json with this complete content:

{
  "username": "your_db_user",
  "password": "your_secure_password",
  "database": "lifeos-ai-council",
  "host": "localhost",

This is for opportunity: Automation Workflow Optimization

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
