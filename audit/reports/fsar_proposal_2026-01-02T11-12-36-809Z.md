# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_2b2e927b-0b90-4f44-a61f-0e06cabc82f5

- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file components/UserDashboard.js with this complete content:

import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; // for validation of props passed into components (if using functional or class components)
import { AppBar, Toolbar, Typography } from '@material-ui/core';

const UserDashboard = ({ userData }) => {
    return <AppBar title={<Typography>{userData.username}</Typography>}></AppBar>; // A simple dashboard component for username display; more functionality can be added as needed (login, logout buttons etc.)
};

UserDashboard.propTypes = {
  userData: PropTypes.shape().isRequired, // Validation that the prop 'userData' is a required object with at least an expected shape defined by your needs. Replace `{}` and `.isRequired` accordingly when adding more props or changing requirements later on.
};

This is for opportunity: Game Overlay Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
