  "proposal": "idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_5.sql with this complete content:\n\n**NOTE: Always handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback to the user, avoiding exposing sensitive information in your responses (e.g., detailed database errors or stack traces), which may aid potential attackers if they were attempting a brute force attack on credentials; rather focus only on informative messages like \"User not found\" or generic access denied/credentials invalid statements to keep security and privacy intact while ensuring user experience is as smooth as possible.**\n\n### Refactoring Additional Endpoints ###\nFor the Overlays creation, update, retrieval, deletion endpoints (not shown due to length), ensure they implement proper authentication checks using PassportJS or similar OAuth strategies that you would have established for user registration/login and also handle password comparison in an asynchronous manner with try-catch blocks where appropriate. Additionally, make sure all sensitive data exchanges are secured via HTTPS and consider implementing CORS policies to restrict access only from known origins if the frontend is hosted on a different server or domain than your backend (omitted here for brevity).\n\n### Database Migrations ###\n`migrations/002_create_overlays_table.js`:\n\nThis is for opportunity: Game Overlay Distribution Platform\nMake sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.",
