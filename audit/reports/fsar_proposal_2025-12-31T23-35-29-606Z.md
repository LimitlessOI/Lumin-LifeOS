# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_735219c8-8af8-4d2f-8c86-d853b40fd485
- timestamp: 2025-12-31T23:35:29.606Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
// Separate endpoint for self-programming system based on insights and data analysis
router.post('/system/self-program', (req, res) => {
    // AI logic to process requests...
});
// Queue tasks in our execution system using the queueing library or service we choose
router.get('/tasks', async () => {
  const taskQueue = require('./taskQueueService');
  return await taskQueue.listTasks();
});
// Stripe integration endpoint to track real-world revenue with logging for read and debugging purposes only, not autonomous charging capabilities
router.post('/revenue/tracking', async (req, res) => {
    // Logic using stripe npm package or CLI tool...
});

This is for opportunity: AI-Driven Service Workflows
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
