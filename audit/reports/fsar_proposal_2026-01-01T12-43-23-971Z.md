    create_table :insights_metrics do |t|
      t.string :insight_name, null: false
      t.text :prediction
      t.float :confidence, default: 0.95, comment: 'Confidence score of the prediction' # Assuming a confidence scale from 0 to 1

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
