- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/interaction-log.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
const { logInteraction } = require('../controllers/loggingController'); // hypothetical controller function to be implemented for logging interactions in Neon database using Sequelize ORM or similar tool.
router.post('/', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        await logInteraction(req.body);
        return res.status(201).send({ message: 'Interaction logged' });
    } catch (error) {
        return res.status(400).send({ error: error.message || "Failed to log interaction." });
    }
});

This is for opportunity: Automated Customer Support Chatbots
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
