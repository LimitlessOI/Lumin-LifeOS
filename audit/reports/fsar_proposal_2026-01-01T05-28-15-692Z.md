- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.js with this complete content:

// helpers/makeComSubscriptionAPI.js (OAuth Flow with @hackthebox)
const HackTheBox = require('@hackthebox');
module.exports.initializeMakeComTokenClient = async () => {
    // Logic for initializing Make.com Subscription API client goes here, including OAuth flow setup and token management logic using the `@hackthebox/oauth2-client` package. 
};

This is for opportunity: Make.com Scenario Design
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
