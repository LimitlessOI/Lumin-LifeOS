idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.sql with this complete content:

-- routes/migrations/002_create_orders.sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS orders (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INTEGER REFEREN0;// Error in the original code snippet: 'REFERENCES' should be 'references'. This seems to have been a mistake during transcription or an incomplete text input. Here is my attempt at correcting and completing this task based on your instructions, without using placeholders such as `<?php` because it does not apply to the programming language context provided (which appears to focus on SQL for schema design and JavaScript/Node.js for backend implementation). I will also ensure that all code is complete within its block:

This is for opportunity: E-commerce Automation Packages

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
