- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/001_create_users_table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255),
    account_status TEXT CHECK (account_status IN ('active', 'inactive', 'suspended')) DEFAULT 'active',
    contact_info JSONB, -- Anonymized personal data could be structured as a jsonb object within this field. 
    FOREIGN KEY (payment_method) REFERENCES payment_records(record_id),
    CONSTRAINT email_unique UNIQUE (email)
);

This is for opportunity: Stripe Integration Enhancement
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
