idea_implementation: Create or update the file components/CourseCreatorUI.js with this complete content:

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import StripeCheckout from '@stripe/checkout-web';
// ... complete file content for the Course Creator UI...

This is for opportunity: Online Course Creation Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
