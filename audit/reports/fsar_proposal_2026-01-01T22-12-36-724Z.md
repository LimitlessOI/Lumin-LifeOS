idea_implementation: Create or update the file ci-cd/pipeline.yml with this complete content:

# CI Pipeline (Jenkinsfile) for building and testing API endpoints, deploying to Kubernetes... 
stages: [ 'Build', 'Test', 'Deploy' ] // List of pipeline stages including build steps using Docker and deployment via kubectl commands or GitHub Actions. ...

This is for opportunity: AI-Driven Income Drones
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
