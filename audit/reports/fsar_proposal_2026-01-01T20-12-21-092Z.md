<!-- File: ./components/_navbar.html -->
<nav role="navigation" aria-labelledby="navbarTitle"> <!-- Ensures that the navigation has appropriate semantic structure and accessibility features -->
  <h2 id="navbarTitle" class="visuallyHidden"><strong>Main Navigation</strong></h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/home">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="/about-us">About Us</a></li> <!-- Highlight the current section -->
      <li><a href="https://yourcompany.com/support" class="btn btn--primary"><span class="activeText"></span>Support Materials</a></li>
    </ul>
  ... rest of your navbar structure...
</nav>

This is for opportunity: Small Business Automation Packages
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
