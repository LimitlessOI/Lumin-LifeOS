- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_4.js with this complete content:

### Additional Required Files ###
For a Rails project:
- Seeders for populating the initial data into development and test databases during migration (dummy content)...
- Task files in `lib/tasks` to handle cron jobs or background processing... 
- Configuration settings specifics such as environment variables, secret keys, etc. ...

This is for opportunity: Online Income Funnel Design
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
