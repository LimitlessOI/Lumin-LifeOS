idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.js with this complete content:

// Routes for self-improvement learning endpoint
const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();

router.post('/', async (req, res) => {
    // Logic to handle AI's self-programming based on feedback and metrics...
});

module.exports = router;
===END FILE===

This is for opportunity: AI-Powered Income Drone Advisory
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
