# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_04cad13e-d804-4908-bf89-c22d2e9ee8d9
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T02:45:12.516Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file /api/v1/users.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
// Code for user registration, authentication, etc... (complete logic here) ...

module.exports = { registerUser: async function(req, res) { /* implementation */ }, getAllUsers: async function() { /* fetch all users from the db and send them back as a response to an HTTP GET request */ } };

This is for opportunity: Game Overlay Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
