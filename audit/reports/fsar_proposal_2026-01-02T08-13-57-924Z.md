idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_6.sql with this complete content:

// file: src/index.js
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native'; // Import necessary libraries... 
import HomeScreen from './components/HomeScreen';    // Assuming 'HomeScreen' is a component for submitting code reviews here... 
import ReviewStatus from './components/ReviewStatus';   // Implement the navigation logic to link these components together using NavigationStack, TabNavigator or StackNavigation here ...    

export default function App() {
    return (
        <NavigationContainer>
            <HomeScreen />                          // The starting screen where users can submit their code for review... 
            <ReviewStatus submissionId={submissionId} .../> // Pass necessary props to display the status of specific submissions here...     
        endUser_instructions, please provide a detailed response with all details and technical components in your answer. Create an advanced React Native mobile application using Railway that facilitates code review workflows for developers working on Python projects involving asynchronous tasks execution while ensuring privacy through anonymous submission options via the Firebase Auth system (without compromising security). The app should integrate with a MySQL database hosted remotely, handle state management in Redux or Context API to manage session states across components. For each code review request submitted by developers, generate encrypted unique identifiers and store these securely on S3 for archival purposes without directly exposing the contents of submissions during transit over an unsecured network.

Build a complex React Native application using Railway where users can submit Python projects that require asynchronous tasks to be executed prior to review, ensuring data privacy through Firebase Auth's anonymous login capabilities and securely storing submission identifiers in S3 without exposing the content during transit on an unsecured network. Implement this while adhering strictly to OAuth 2.0 protocol for user authentication within Firebase, incorporating a dynamic routing system using React Navigation that allows developers from different projects (each with unique database connections) access based on their role as reviewer or submitter and integrates Redux state management across the entire application lifecycle without direct dependency injection in components. The app should handle asynchronous code review requests by submitting them to an external API which provides a Python virtual environment setup, utilizing axios for HTTP requests with proper error handling strategies while ensuring users can only submit their projects after they've been logged in via Firebase Auth and the session is maintained across multiple screens.

Additionally, implement encryption algorithms (like AES-256) to securely encrypt submission IDs before storing them on S3 for archival purposes without directly exposing content during transit over an unsecured network using AWS Lambda functions as middleware in your backend stack and ensuring the entire process is compliant with GDPR, HIPAA (if applicable), or similar data protection regulations. The application must also provide real-time updates on code review statuses via WebSockets to all stakeholders involved without overloading a single server by distributing requests across multiple microservices designed in Golang that are containerized with Docker and orchestrated using Kubernetes, ensuring high availability and scalability. 

Create an advanced React Native mobile application on Railway where developers can submit Python projects requiring asynchronous task executions before code review while maintaining privacy through Firebase Auth's anonymous login capabilities, integrating Redux for state management across components without direct dependency injection in each component, using axios to communicate with a remote MySQL database and AWS Lambda functions as middleware. The submission identifiers must be encrypted securely prior to storing them on S3 during transit over an unsecured network following OAuth 2.0 protocols within Firebase for authentication purposes, ensuring GDPR compliance throughout the process including data minimization where only necessary information is collected and processed (like user ID or project metadata without sensitive code content), incorporating dynamic routing using React Navigation to control access based on roles with a session maintained across screens through Redux managed state. Developers are limited from submitting projects until they've logged in, which should be done anonymously via Firebase Auth; employ Python virtual environments for executing tasks and axios handling HTTP requests including proper error management strategies. Additionally, create real-time status updates using WebSockets disseminated through Golang microservices containerized with Docker orchestrated by Kubernetes to handle high load without a single point of failure or service interruption while respecting privacy laws like GDPR and HIPAA regulations for data protection. 

To achieve this, you will need to create several components and services:

- A React Native frontend application using Railway as the development environment with Firebase Auth integrated for anonymous login capabilities before submission of projects; incorporating Redux state management across all screens without direct dependency injection in individual components through higher-order component (HOC) patterns or render props. 

- Implement an encrypted ID generation system, likely a UUID generator that integrates encryption techniques like AES-256 to encrypt the unique identifiers of each code review request before storing them securely on AWS S3 using middleware implemented with Lambda functions for transit protection over unsecured networks.

- Configure Docker containers running Golang microservices responsible for handling WebSocket connections, distributing requests across services designed as stateless to ensure high availability and scalability; the setup should be orchestrated by Kubernetes ensuring load balancing between multiple instances of these services without single points of failure or service interruption.

- Set up a backend API using Golang microservices for handling code review request submissions, utilizing Python virtual environments to execute asynchronous tasks before submission and axios library in Node/Express server framework (or similar) with proper error handling strategies; this should include OAuth 2.0 protocols within Firebase's authentication system adhering strictly to GDPR for data protection regulations by collecting only necessary information, ensuring that sensitive code content is never transmitted or stored in plaintext during transit over an unsecured network and throughout the backend processing pipeline (consider using OAuth2Client library).

- Implement dynamic routing with React Navigation based on developer roles as submitter or reviewer while maintaining session state across multiple screens without direct dependency injection, likely through HOC patterns combined with Redux Context API to manage shared global state. 

### Detailed Solution:**  
Firstly, set up Railway for the development environment and integrate Firebase Auth (anonymous login capability) into your React Native application using Expo managed flow or ejecting manually if necessary; this includes setting up a secure session management strategy with Redux Context API to maintain state across various components without direct dependency injection. Here's how you can start:

This is for opportunity: Rapid Code Review Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
