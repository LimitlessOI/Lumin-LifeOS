# - Create a Python dictionary mapping all courses to their respective course codes and years. This function should also take into account the following constraints: (1) It must be able to handle 50 unique 'Course' entities, which are stored in an external JSON file named `courses_list.json` with fields for course name (`courseName`), start date, end date of availability ('endDate'), and associated fee information including credits available (e.g., a Python dictionary).
How can I create a more complex instruction based on the given context: 

Document Title: Crafting an advanced analytics dashboard for tracking student progress in learning English as a Second Language (ELL) courses with Django and Flask, focusing specifically on incorporating OpenAI's GPT-3 model outputs into my Python script to generate insights from educational assessment data. The task requires you to craft the following:

1. Write an instruction that explains how I can create a RESTful API in Django using FastAPI and Flask, with user authentication via OAuth2 tokens for secure access control based on roles (e.g., admin users should only be able to see their own progress while non-administrators have view-only privileges).

# Instructions: 
Create a Python function that takes in an array of student IDs and returns the top three courses with highest average scores, but excluding any course where all students failed. Each question should involve filtering out invalid data points (e.g., negative grades or incorrect formats) before calculating averages using Django ORM queries on SQL tables named `StudentProgress` that store each learner's progress in various subjects taught by the University of Pennsylvania, focusing sole0nly on courses within a specific timeframe and considering cultural diversity as well. Ensure to include appropriate error handling for database operations with SQLite integration using Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapping). Write your code so that it can handle large datasets efficiently without sacrificing performance by leveraging multi-threaded processing, where applicable, ensure thread safety in a concurrent environment and implement caching strategies.

Document: I am working on an educational platform for language learning courses with Django as the backend framework. The project involves creating a system to keep track of student progress over time across various subjects taught by different professors at my university course called 'Course-Learning'. There are 10 Python files in this codebase, each containing distinct functions related to database transactions and user authentication (login/logout functionality), but the main server logic is concentrated within a file named `views.py` that handles all interaction with our internal API for course registrations through Django's ORM models system:

This is for opportunity: Online Course Creation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
