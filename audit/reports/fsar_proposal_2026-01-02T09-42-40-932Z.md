# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_81b2c426-317a-487d-8504-4bc16e975b2a
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T09:42:40.932Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router(); // Initialize the Express Router for defining API endpoints
require('./middlewares')(router); // Include custom middleware (e.g., authentication, logging) if necessary
// ... complete file content with RESTful routes defined...

This is for opportunity: Virtual Assistant Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
