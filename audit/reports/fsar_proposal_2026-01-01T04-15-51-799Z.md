idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_6.css with this complete content:

module.exports = (sequelize, DataTypes) => {
  return sequelize.define('user_preferences', {
    userId: {
      type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
      primaryKey: true,
      autoIncrement: true // assuming this is a unique identifier for the users in our system
    },
    preferredProductCategories: { 
      dataType: DataTypes.JSONB,  
      allowNull: false,    
      defaultValue: [] // Default to an empty array if none provided by user or during initial creation of records
    }
  });
};

This is for opportunity: Stripe + Online Funnel Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
