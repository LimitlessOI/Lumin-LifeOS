idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_8.css with this complete content:

import stripe
from flask import jsonify

def convert_currency(amount, from_currency, to_currency):
    # Implement logic for fetching real-time exchange rates (omitted due to brevity).
    
stripe.api_key = get_secret("STRIPE_SECRET")  # Ensure API keys are securely managed using environment variables or a secret management system like HashiCorp's Vault, AWS KMS etc.

@app.route('/process-payment', methods=['POST'])
async def process_order():
    try:
        order_id = request.form.get('code')  # Assuming 'code' is the discount code in Stripe format (omitted due to brevity).
        
        charge_info = stripe.Charge.create(amount=calculate_final_price_with_currency(order_data['total'] * Decimal(stripe_rate), order_data, currency='usd'),  # This is pseudocode as Stripe API integration needs to handle complex logic (omitted due to length constraints).
                                       source=charge_info)
        
        await process_payment_async() if user.is_stripe_crypto(order_data['email'], order_id, charge_info)  # Assuming 'user' is an object that holds customer-specific data and has a method for processing payments (omitted due to length constraints).
        
        return jsonify({"status": "success"}), 200
    except stripe.StripeError as e:
        log.error('An error occurred while interacting with Stripe API', exc_info=True)

This is for opportunity: Stripe Integration and Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
