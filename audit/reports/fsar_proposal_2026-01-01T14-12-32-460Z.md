# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_ec49cc12-d33b-4615-b81d-41d9b0821116
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T14:12:32.460Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_4.js with this complete content:

// JavaScript logic (File Path: public/js/)
const overlayInteractionLog = require('./overlay_interaction_log');  // Fictional module providing API interactions with the backend game logging endpoints, e.g., fetching interaction data for display on frontend UI components and sending logs to back-end storage.
// Initialize necessary JavaScript modules or scripts...

This is for opportunity: Overlay Game Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
