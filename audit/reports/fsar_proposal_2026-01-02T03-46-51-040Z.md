- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS business_models (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id), -- Ensuring foreign key relationship with our primary table for data integrity and normalization. This is a simplified example as actual relationships might be more complex based on real-world requirements 
    industry SMALLINT CHECK (industry BETWEEN 1 AND 50) NOT NULL, -- Assuming we have defined some industries in advance with corresponding IDs which would replace 'SMALLINT' to a larger integer type and also include appropriate indices for performance optimization. Not included here due to the complexity of demonstrating within this format’s limitations
    revenue_potential DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL -- To capture potential revenues with adequate precision without floats which could cause rounding issues in calculations 
);  
-- Financial records table and other necessary ones would also be created here following similar patterns. Stripe-related fields should not exist directly within the database for security reasons, hence they are to interact via secure API calls only as per PCI compliance standards which is mentioned but omitted due to complexity limitations

This is for opportunity: Business Model Duplication Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
