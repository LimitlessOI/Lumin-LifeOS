- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/001_create_custom_scenarios_table.sql with this complete content:

BEGIN TRANSA0;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS custom_scenarios (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    revenue_projection NUMERIC(8, 2),
    employee_id INTEGER REFERENCES employees(id) ON DELETE SET NULL, -- Assuming there is an 'employees' table and a foreign key relationship.
    status VARCHAR CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'active', 'completed')) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending'
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_custom_scenario_name ON custom_scenarios(name); -- Ensures uniqueness of scenario names for tracking purposes within Lightweight Assistant.
COMMIT;

This is for opportunity: Custom Make.com Scenarios
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
