- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/003_create_orders_table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS orders (
    order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    payment_id INT REFEREN0S payments(payment_id),
    product_details JSONB NOT NULL, -- Assuming a structure for product/service details 
    quantity INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

This is for opportunity: Stripe Integration Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
