- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_7.js with this complete content:

from retry import retry
import requests

@retry(tries=5, delay=2) # Retry failed requests up to 5 times with a 2-second pause between retries.
def fetch_data(url):
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        if not response.ok or 'CAPTCHA' in response.text:
            raise Exception('Encountered CAPTCHA')  # This exception handling is intentionally vague for illustration purposes only; customize as needed to handle specific exceptions and errors encountered during requests, such as timeouts, HTTPError, etc. Include best practices on securing API keys or sensitive data within the script using environment variables.
        return response.json()  # Assuming JSON responses from web pages for simplicity here
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")

This is for opportunity: Self-programming System
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
