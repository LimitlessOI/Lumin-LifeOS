idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_7.html with this complete content:

---FILE:frontend/index.js===
import React from 'react';
// Example component structure that could tie into the backend dashboard features later on
const Dashboard = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            {/* Front-end UI elements here */}
        </div>
    );
};
export default Dashboard;
---END FILE===

This is for opportunity: AI-Driven Business Process Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
