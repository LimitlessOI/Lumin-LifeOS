- id: fsar_96634a90-58bc-4016-abe6-a8f27806301c
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T23:27:29.548Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file models/migrations.js with this complete content:

const Sequelize = require('sequelize');
require('dotenv').config();

module.exports = function(Sequelize) {
  const sequelize = new Sequelize(process.env.DATABASE, process.env.USERNAME, process.env.PASSWORD, { host: 'localhost', dialect: 'postgres' }); // Replace with actual environment variables or config file load for production
  
  // Migration files will go here (e.g., sequelize-cli migrations)
}

This is for opportunity: LifeOS Automation Consultancy
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
