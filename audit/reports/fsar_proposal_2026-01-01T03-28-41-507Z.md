### API Endpoint to Get User Searches within a Specific Time Frame (Google Analytics and PostgreSQL integration assumed for analytics data) - Assumption of an existing function `get_user_searches` which retrieves user searches from Google Analytics or another similar service that provides this kind of information

This is for opportunity: AI-Driven SEO Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
