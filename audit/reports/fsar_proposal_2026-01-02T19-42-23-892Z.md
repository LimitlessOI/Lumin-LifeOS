const router = express.Router();

router.get('/scenarios', (req, res) => {
  // Fetch and return scenarios list from the database for GET request to /api/v1/scenarios
});

router.post('/clients/:client_id/scenarios', async (req, res) => {

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
