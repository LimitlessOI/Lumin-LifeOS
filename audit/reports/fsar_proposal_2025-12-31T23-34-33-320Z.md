idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/001_create_table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS customers (
  customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE
);
-- Additional table creations for orders and other required tables would follow here with necessary constraints like foreign keys.

Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
