# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_803d22bc-fb4a-4e94-94db-85ccb0b2796f
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T14:12:32.353Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.sql with this complete content:

-- File Name: migration_create_user_table.sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);
// ... additional migrations for other tables...

This is for opportunity: Overlay Game Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
