- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api/v1/clients with this complete content:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const stripe = require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY); // Ensure to set STRIPE_SECRET_KEY in production environment variables for security reasons
const router = new express.Router();

// Endpoint: Create a client profile with Stripe information and business type (E-commerce)
router.post('/', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const session = await stripe.setupSession(req.body.stripe_checkout_session); // Using Checkout to capture payment details securely through Stripe's hosted form
        
        req.session.id = session.id; // Store the Session ID in user'selfesession for later use (e.g., during charge)
        
        res.status(201).json({ clientId: uuidv4(), stripeSessionId: session.id });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Stripe setup error', error);
        res.status(500).send('Error setting up Stripe');
    }
});
```

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
