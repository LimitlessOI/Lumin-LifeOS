idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_5.sql with this complete content:

from channels.generic.websocket import JsonWebsocketConsumer
import json

class ScenariosConsumer(JsonWebsocketConsumer):
    def connect(self):
        self.accept()
    
    async def disconnect(self, close_code):
        pass  # Handle closing the connection if needed.
    
    async def receive_json(self, content, **kwargs):
        message = json.loads(content)
        
        scenario_id = str(message['scenario_id'])
        await self.send(text_data=json.dumps({'event': 'update', 'payload': {'newStatus': message.get('status')}}))  # Simulated real-time update payload for the websocket connection.

This is for opportunity: Make.com Scenario Generation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
