# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_644c808b-617d-455f-a6f3-92445a00bac9
- timestamp: 2025-12-31T23:35:02.422Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file config.js with this complete content:

module.exports = {
  database_url: 'postgres://user:password@localhost/neon', // Replace with actual credentials or environment variables for production deployment on Railway's robust-magic setup
  stripeKey: process.env.STRIPE_SECRET, // Ensure this is set in the environment variable before deploying to production and not hardcoded into application code
};

This is for opportunity: Game Development for Overlay Distribution
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
