idea_implementation: Create or update the file Dockerfile with this complete content:

```dockerfile
# Use an official Node runtime as a parent image, adjust version numbers based on current best practices and compatibility 
FROM node:14-slim AS base
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --production && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* # Adjust for Python or other language dependencies if using a multi-language stack. 
# Copy over the rest of your codebase here, typically done in 'build' stages to avoid sending secrets into production image (not shown).
```

Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
