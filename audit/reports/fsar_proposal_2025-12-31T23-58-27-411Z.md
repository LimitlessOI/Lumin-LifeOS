- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_4.js with this complete content:

// File: config/environments/production.js (This is just an illustrative example)
require('dotenv').config(); // Assuming use of .env for sensitive info in Railway Railways' production environment setup as per Rails conventions.

module.exports = function(environment, env) {
  return {
    databaseSchema: 'development', // Placeholder; typically set based on the deployment server details or via command line arguments when starting up within Railway Railways system infrastructure settings.
    
    secretToken: process.env.SECRET_TOKEN || "placeholder-secret", // Replace with actual tokens provided by the system admin for production setup if needed, otherwise use Rails defaults which are securely managed in `.env` files or directly within configuration classes/modules (not shown here).
  };
};

This is for opportunity: Rapid SaaS Cloning
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
