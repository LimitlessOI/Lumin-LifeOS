  "proposal": "idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api.js with this complete content:\n\nconst express = require('express');\nconst router = new express.Router();\n\n// Businesses CRUD operations - GET /businesses, POST /businesses -- create a business record\nrouter.get('/', (req, res) => { /* implementation to fetch and return all existing business records */ });\nrouter.post('/', /* implementation to add new business using incoming data */);\nrouter.delete('/:id', (req, res) => { /* remove the specified business by id */ });\n// Consultations CRUD operations - GET /consultations -- list consultation requests for a specific user or all users if none provided; POST /conunsculations to create new ones based on needs submitted in request body. \nrouter.get('/', (req, res) => { /* implementation fetching and returning businesses' available consultation records */ });\nrouter.post('/:business_id', /* logic for creating a linked consultation record against the specified 'business_id' with incoming data in request body*/); \n// Tasks CRUD operations - GET /tasks, POST/PUT/DELETE routes to create or update tasks and delete them by id. Link these directly back into businesses if needed so they can be queued for processing using the task queue endpoint (e.g., '/api/v1/self-program').\nrouter.get('/', /* implementation returning all current pending, in-progress, completed tasks */); \nrouter.post('/:business_id/:task_name', /* logic to create a new or update an existing task against the specified business and name -- link this back into consultation records as necessary */ );  \nrouter.delete('/:task_id', (req, res) => {/* remove specific tasks by id from all associated tables using foreign keys */}); \n// Revenue Tracking GET route - Fetch revenue tracking data linked to each completed task and business for ROI analysis purposes. This would likely use pre-captured Stripe transactional IDs with corresponding statuses in the 'revenue_tracking' table we create next. Only provide read access here (i.e., no form of direct updates allowed).\nrouter.get('/:task_id', /* implementation to fetch and return revenue tracking data for a specific task */); \n// Stripe Payment Endpoint - POST /payments -- this would handle capturing payment transactions via the external Stripe API, with no autonomous charging but instead using Rails self-programming endpoint as an interface between system AI and stripe services to log successful payments into our revenue tracking table.\nrouter.post('/', /* implementation handling form submission for accepting a user's request in payment via the external Stripe API, sending back necessary confirmation data */); \n// Self-Programming Endpoint - GET /api/v1/system/self-program -- this would be used as an interface by system AI to queue new tasks or consultations based on incoming user requests through React.js frontend forms (this will need implementation using Ruby's Sidekiq for task queuing with Rails).\nrouter.get('/', /* implement a simple GET endpoint that can handle form submissions from the self-programming interface, forwarding this to our internal job queue system */); \n\n// Revenue Tracking Route - Read only access -- This would allow consultations and tasks tied back into them (through foreign keys) with their respective revenue data. Display on frontend charts for ROI analysis purposes; actual tracking implementation will be done by Rails directly pulling from the 'revenue_tracking' table we create in next step, linking this endpoint to a chart visualization component if needed through React or Vue.\nrouter.get('/:business_id', /* logic fetching all revenue linked back to businesses for ROI analysis and display */); \n// Don't forget Express middleware like `express-validator` for data validation, error handling with express-status-codes & custom Errors classes in the global scope. Add CORS setup using 'cors' package if needed depending on your Rails backend configuration or deployment strategy (i.g., Railways internal system).\n// Endpoints assume some external dependencies and services are already integrated such as Stripe, Sidekiq for job queuing with Laravel/PHP & RSpec respectively - these need to be implemented in the full application setup but not shown here due to scope of this response; ensure all API endpoints work correctly using Postman or similar tools before deployment.\n\nThis is for opportunity: Automation Workflow Consulting\nMake sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.",
