idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_5.js with this complete content:

*Integration tests using Selenium WebDriver.* (Hypothetical snippet for user-behavior simulation) 

Please note that the following is a conceptual representation and assumes you have set up end2end testing with proper tools like Mocha, Chai, or Cypress which would be part of your ecosystem outside this platform. This approach should match Railway's JavaScript setup if it includes Selenium WebDriver for front-to-back integration tests:

This is for opportunity: Instant Service Workflow Design
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
