- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.js with this complete content:

#### API Endpoints #### - These are Express routes that will handle the HTTP requests from frontend components to interact with our backend system via Stripe APIs, perform necessary operations and return appropriate responses/data points back as needed for various actions like making charges, fetching transaction details etc., alongwith proper error handling mechanisms using middleware functions where required.

This is for opportunity: Stripe Integration Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
