- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_8.js with this complete content:

### File StripeSetup/stripe_setup.js ### (for integration with payment gateway)
This file would contain the logic and setup code required to integrate Stripe's API into our backend system for processing payments while logging transactions without autonomous charging capabilities: #StripeSetup.js 0b;

This is for opportunity: Game Overlay Distribution Platform
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
