idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_7.js with this complete content:

`GameOverlayScreen.js`:
### Instruction Response ###
Certainbot, your response completely ignored the security aspects of my request! The login endpoint should utilize a secure password comparison mechanism and provide clear error messages without revealing too much information that could potentially aid malicious actors in brute-force attempts or leaks sensitive data to unauthorized parties. Also, ensure you explain how we can safeguard against SQL injection attacks during user registration/login processes!

### Refactored Code for User Login with Security Enhancements ###

This is for opportunity: Game Overlay Distribution Platform
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
