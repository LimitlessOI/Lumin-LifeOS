- id: fsar_8b86ba1b-829d-4ed5-bdfd-78e01593a5da
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T17:14:10.719Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file views/dashboard_tasks.html with this complete content:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- The dashboard template for displaying tasks -->
... 
/// Assume further HTML and JS content here that interacts with the Express API routes to display real-time analytics about task assignments, including prioritization based on ML predictions if applicable (not executable code). This file should link back to your server's endpoint `/api/tasks`.

This is for opportunity: AI-Powered Automation Services
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
