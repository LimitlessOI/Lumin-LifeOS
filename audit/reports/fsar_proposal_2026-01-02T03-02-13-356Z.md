idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_4.js with this complete content:

-- Additional tables for 'courses', `subscriptions`, and potentially others like transactions might be necessary based on further business logic of revenue capture mechanisms integration with Stripe payments. Implementing these alongside referential integrity constraints ensures robust end-to-end functionality across Rails backend as required before live deployment (Day 31).

This is for opportunity: Subscription-based Coding Tutorials
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
