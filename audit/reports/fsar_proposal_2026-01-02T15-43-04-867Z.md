- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const stripe = require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY); // Stripe Integration placeholder
const router = express.Router();

// API Endpoints Setup (Express Routes)
router.get('/api/v1/user', getUsers);
router.post('/api/v1/template', createTemplate);
router.delete('/api/v1/session-management/logout', logoutUser); // Assuming sessions are managed with a middleware, e.g., express-session or similar
router.get('/api/v1/generate-website/:id', generateWebsiteFromTemplate);
// ... more routes as required for the API endpoints...

module.exports = router;

This is for opportunity: Instant Website Generator
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
