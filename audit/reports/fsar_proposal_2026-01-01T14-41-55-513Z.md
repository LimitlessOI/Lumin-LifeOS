- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.sql with this complete content:

-- Assuming the schema is already created, here's how you might set up a simplified version of it. Adjust field types and constraints based on detailed business requirements.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS customers (
  customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  -- Additional fields like phone number or address could be added here if needed...
);

This is for opportunity: Real-Time ROI Tracking System
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
