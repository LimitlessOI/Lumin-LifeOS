# FSAR Proposal Report

- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file /api/v1/games.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
// Code for games API endpoints (POST /games, get all) ... 

module.exports = { createGame: async function(req, res) { /* logic to add a new game */ }, findGamesByIdentifier: async function() { /* fetch specific games by IDENTIFIER and return them as response with HTTP GET request */ } };

This is for opportunity: Game Overlay Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
