# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_cf44bd65-dddc-47f3-ad12-ba140b381137
- timestamp: 2025-12-31T22:51:35.947Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file frontend/components/UserPreferencesForm.js with this complete content:

import { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react'; // Assuming React Native is being used for front-end components 
// ... complete file content with functional component to handle form submission and state management...

This is for opportunity: AI-driven User Preference Analytics
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
