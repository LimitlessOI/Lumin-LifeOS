#### Phase 8: Revenue Capture Mechanism Design & Implementation Execution Planning (Day 21) ####
Final review of system health, validation metrics for all components through testing as per the TDD approach outlined. Perform a dry run with mock data to simulate business operations and ensure that revenue capture mechanisms are working correctly without actual transactions involved before going live on Railway's robust-magic production environment (not fully detailed here due to scope limitations).

This is for opportunity: Automation Strategy Consulting
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
