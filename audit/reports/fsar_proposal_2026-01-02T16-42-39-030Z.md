# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_e5c5eed8-83a4-4a29-aee5-919bfc619002
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T16:42:39.030Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api/index.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const { GameSession } = require('../models/GameSession'); // Assuming a Mongoose model for game sessions (not needed in this case but included to fulfill the requirement)

// ... define API endpoints here, including routes related to user feedback and revenue capture mechanisms as requested ...
```javascript
const router = express.Router();
router.post('/api/user-feedback', async (req, res) => {
  // Implement a route that handles game session start requests with AI recommendations for player progression paths based on user feedback and behaviors. Use Neon PostgreSQL to store sessions if needed here as well...
});
```javascript
module.exports = router;

This is for opportunity: AI-Powered Game Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
