- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api_designs.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
const DesignService = require('../services/DesignService'); // Hypothetical service for handling design operations

router.post('/submit', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const submissionResult = await DesignService.submit(req.body);
        return res.status(201).json({ message: 'Design submitted successfully!', id: submissionResult.id });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error submitting design: ', error);
        return res.status(500).send('An internal server error occurred');
    }
});

This is for opportunity: Overlay Distribution Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
