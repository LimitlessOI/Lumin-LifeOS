# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_5e6d8e80-2a04-4a70-8471-cb8054fa96ae
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T23:27:29.749Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file test/app.test.js with this complete content:

const request = require('supertest'); // Import necessary testing libraries (e.g., jest, chai) and express app from '../app' for proper tests setup
// ... test code to simulate API calls...
module.exports = { /* Test suites here */ };

This is for opportunity: LifeOS Automation Consultancy
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
