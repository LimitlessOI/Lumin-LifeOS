- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS player_metrics (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    gamedb_id INT REFERENCES games(id),
    timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    score INT,
    level INT,
    retention_days INTEGER,
    engagement_time DECIMAL(10, 2) -- Average time spent in minutes and seconds. e.g., '75.5' for 1 hour and 15 minutes
);

This is for opportunity: AI Overlay for Game Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
