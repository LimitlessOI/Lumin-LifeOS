- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/2023_04_15_create_table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_preference_analytics (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id BIGINT REFERENCES users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  preferences JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

This is for opportunity: AI-driven User Preference Analytics
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
