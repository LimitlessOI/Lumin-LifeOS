- id: fsar_6e559fee-8e75-4544-8fd9-edc93e756932
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T04:14:43.703Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_8.js with this complete content:

// configs/.env file would go here including: STORE_API_KEY="sk_test..." CUSTOMER_TABLE=customers WALLET_COLLECTION=wallets DASHBOARD_CACHE_LAMBDA=/* Cache lambda function code for caching mechanisms (optional) -- to be auto-generated using `touch .env` command if not already present with standard content.

This is for opportunity: Stripe Integration Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
