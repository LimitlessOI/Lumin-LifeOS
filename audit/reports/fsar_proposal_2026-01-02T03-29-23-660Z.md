idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.sql with this complete content:

-- migrations/001_create_table.sql - Database migration SQL script for creating necessary tables and relationships within Neon PostgreSQL database schema required to store user data, course information etc., ensuring normalized structure with appropriate indexes as needed based on query patterns expected in the system...
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, -- or UUID/BIGINT equivalent for non-sequential IDs.
  username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash CHAR(64), // Assuming SHA256 hashed passwords are used; adjust length as needed based on the chosen hashing algorithm and salting strategy...
  role ENUM('admin', 'student') DEFAULT 'student', -- or implement a more granular user roles model for future expansion.
  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AT TIME ZONE 'UTC', -- Standardizing timestamps to UTC and ensuring timezone awareness in the system...
  // Indexes on username, email for optimized search performance during user authentication/registration processes. Potential additional indices or constraints may be implemented based on evolving application requirements such as unique course titles within each catalog entry (e.g., UNIQUE(course_title, category))...
);
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS courses (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, -- Unique identifier for each learning path/courses in the system; assumes one-to-many relationship with users table as a course can have multiple enrolled students. Adjust data types and relationships accordingly based on actual application design choices...
  title VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  description TEXT, -- or implement structured JSON/XML for more complex content descriptions if needed in the future; assumes simple textual course information is sufficient at this stage. Adjustments can be made based on evolving requirements...
  difficulty_level ENUM('beginner', 'intermediate', 'advanced') DEFAULT 'beginner', -- or an integer skill rating system for more granular categorization of courses/content; assumed simplicity initially with potential expansion in the future as per demand and application growth. Adjustments to this field can be made based on user feedback, learning analytics data etc., during subsequent iterations...
  category VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'general', -- or a more complex content classification system if needed (e.g., programming languages, subject matter); assumed general courses for initial launch with potential expansion in the future as per demand and application growth. Adjustments to this field can be made based on user feedback, learning analytics data etc., during subsequent iterations...
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AT TIME ZONE 'UTC', -- Ensuring timestamps are stored in UTC for consistency and to facilitate synchronous operations across different time zones. Adjustments can be made based on evolving requirements...
  last_updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AT TIME ZONE 'UTC', -- Auto-updating timestamp for whenever the course content is modified; assumes manual update implementation initially with potential automatic updating mechanisms implemented in future iterations as per application growth and scalability considerations...
  deleted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE, -- Assuming soft deletion strategy by marking courses/courses data points to be potentially 'deleted' without immediate physical removal from the database; this approach allows for historical reference analytics or retrieval of "soft-deleted" content if necessary based on evolving system requirements...
  // Foreign key relationship established with user table ID as a cascade delete option by default, assuming one course per student to simplify initial application design and avoid complex many-to-many relationships; adjustments can be made in subsequent iterations for potential expansion into more advanced systems including multiple enrollment capabilities (e.g., GROUP BY or JOIN operations)...
);
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS reviews (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, -- Unique identifier used to store course review data provided by users; assumed a simple textual content storage approach initially with potential expansion in the future as per demand and application growth...
  user_id BIGINT REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE, -- Assumes one-to-many relationship where each course can have multiple reviews from different students; adjustment to this field based on evolving requirements such as direct linkage between courses and review data for improved performance during retrieval operations...
  course_id BIGINT REFERENCES courses(id) ON DELETE CASCADE, -- Establishing many-to-one relationship where a single course can receive multiple reviews from different users; assumes cascade delete option on both ends to maintain data integrity in case of deletion or updates...
  content TEXT NOT NULL, -- Placeholder for review text input/output by the user storing their feedback about courses they've completed and experiences with learning paths offered. Adjustments can be made based on evolving requirements such as richer multimedia reviews (e.g., video links), rating systems or more structured data formats like JSON to accommodate diverse content types provided in future iterations...
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMEZONE AT TIME ZONE 'UTC', -- Timestamps for review creation, assuming a consistent UTC time zone standard across the system; adjustments can be made based on evolving requirements such as localized timestamp handling in future iterations...
  // Additional fields or indices implemented here depending upon application's growing needs and performance considerations like indexing to optimize search/query operations related to reviews (e.g., index(user_id, course_id) for optimized retrieval of specific user-course review pairs)...

This is for opportunity: Personalized Learning Platforms
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
