# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_63b7e9dc-f002-4a11-a226-1bc58060a5fd
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T16:42:39.082Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file models/GameSession.js with this complete content:

const mongoose = require('mongoose'); // Assuming MongoDB for the sake of this example, but you would replace with Neon PostgreSQL or similar if using a different database system
// ... define Mongoose model (or equivalent ORM) for game sessions here...
```javascript
module.exports = GameSession;

This is for opportunity: AI-Powered Game Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
