- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file components/ArtistSubmissionForm.js with this complete content:

import React from 'react';
import { createMint } from './artCreateHelperFunctions'; // Assuming existence of a helper function to handle NFT minting logic, not provided here due to missing specific details but should be implemented as part of the complete system with actual Stripe and blockchain integration.

export default class ArtistSubmissionForm extends React.Component {
    state = {
        artwork: '', // Placeholder for submitted NFT metadata (title, description)...
        socialLinks: {},
    };
    
    onArtworkChange = e => this.setState({artwork: e.target.value});
    handleSubmit = e => {
        e.preventDefault();
        lifeosaiHandler.createNewArtwork(this.state.artwork, this.state.socialLinks); // Assuming 'lifeosaiHandler' is a module that handles art creation logic and blockchain interactions with NFT minting...
    }
    
    render() {
        return (
            <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
                <input type="text" value={this.state.artwork} onChange={this.onArtworkChange} placeholder="Enter artwork metadata"/>
                {/* Inputs for social links and other artist details */}
                <button type="submit">Mint NFT</button> // Submit button to trigger the create new artwork logic, not provided here due to missing specific details but assumed as part of a complete system.
            endform)
    }
}

This is for opportunity: AI-Generated Artwork for NFTs
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
