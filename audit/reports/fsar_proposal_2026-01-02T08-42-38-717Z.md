# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_2d986085-a282-4a72-ad4b-1c6f0d75a2bc
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T08:42:38.717Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_5.js with this complete content:

3. Configuration files - `config.json`: (assuming we're using dotenv for environment variables)

This is for opportunity: Make.com Scenario Generation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
