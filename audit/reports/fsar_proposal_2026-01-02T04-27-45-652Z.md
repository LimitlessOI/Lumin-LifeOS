- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file config/deploymentEnvironment.json with this complete content:

{
    "production": { /* production environment specific settings */ }, 
    "development": { /* development environment specific settings */ }  
}

This is for opportunity: Game Development Overlay Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
