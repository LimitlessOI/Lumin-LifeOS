idea_implementation: Create or update the file components/AdminDashboard.js with this complete content:

import React from 'react';
// Required imports for Admin Dashboard UI components and logic to display tasks, etc.
class AdminDashboard extends React.Component {
    // ... complete code with state management and rendering of dashboard elements...
}
export default AdminDashboard;

This is for opportunity: AI-Powered Business Automation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
