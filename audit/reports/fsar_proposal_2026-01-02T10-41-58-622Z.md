idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_4.html with this complete content:

import React from 'react';
import { connect } from 'redux'; // Assuming Redux state management is used here as well

class TasksListTab extends React.Component {
    render() {
        const tasks = this.props.tasks;
        
        return (
            <div>
                {/* Render the task list with deadlines and statuses */}
            end_of_component=</div>
        );
    }
}

This is for opportunity: Remote Work Optimization Services
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
