# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_3d4db0af-b3b1-48c3-baa7-168fa73912a8
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T04:15:51.541Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.js with this complete content:

const { execSync } = require('child_process');

// Initialize Node environment variables, if necessary setup PostgreSQL database connection parameters here 
... // (No code needed as this is a shell script for setting up the project)

console.log("Initializing development server and loading dependencies.");

This is for opportunity: Stripe + Online Funnel Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
