idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_4.html with this complete content:

import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'; // For React components 
// Or import and use appropriate hooks for Vue.js...
const DashboardComponent = () => {
    const [data, setData] = useState([]);

    useEffect(() => {
        fetch('/api/v1/income_drone/snapshots') // or equivalent in a Vue component lifecycle methods 
            .then(...)
            .then((response) => response.json())
            .then((data) => setData(data));

Replace with actual code as needed for your environment or scripting language of choice if not Bash/Shell Scripting System AI (Local): I can queue tasks and assist you directly within this system, but my ability is limited to text generation without executing live commands on external systems such as a PostgreSQL database using SQL. However, here's an example that simulates the process of creating table migrations in pseudo-code since actual implementation details will depend greatly on your specific environment and requirements:

Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
