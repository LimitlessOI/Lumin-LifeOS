- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.sql with this complete content:

// migrations/001_create_table.sql - Neon PostgreSQL database migration file (simplified)
-- truncate existing tables if they exist to start clean -- assuming this is a script run before deploying new changes: 
TRUNCATE TABLE users;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    role ENUM('admin', 'user') DEFAULT 'user' -- assuming roles are either admin or user for simplicity 
);
-- more tables and relationships would be defined here...

Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
