idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_6.js with this complete content:

### Testing Strategy ###: You would typically include test files in your project setup. Here is a basic example for express routes testing, assuming you have `mocha`, `chai` and `@babel/core` installed along with Babel plugins to support ES6+ syntax transpilation if needed (installation not shown here):

This is for opportunity: LifeOS Game Overlay Platform
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
