# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_49db3d56-0694-452a-988f-448c0af50b3c
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T19:12:52.010Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file /config/database.js with this complete content:

require('dotenv').config(); // Load environment variables from .env file for DATABASE_URL and other sensitive data needed during runtime 
const { Sequelize } = require('sequelize');

module.exports = new Sequelize({
    dialect: 'postgres',
    host: process.env.DB_HOST, // Replace with actual database host from .env file or your environment configuration setup as needed for production deployment 
    port: parseInt(process.env.DB_PORT),
    username: process.env.DB_USERNAME,
    password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD,
    database: 'MakeComScenarioGen', // Database name set in `./db/development.js` or similar file for development setup 
});

This is for opportunity: Make.com Scenario Generation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
