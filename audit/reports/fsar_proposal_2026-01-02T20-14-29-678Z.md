idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.sql with this complete content:

// File: routes/revenue_tracking.js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const { getScenarioRevenue } = require('./services'); // Assuming this service function handles Stripe payments and database interactions, defined elsewhere in your codebase
  
router.post('/revenue', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const paymentData = req.body;
    
    if (!validatePaymentRequest(paymentData)) { // Assuming this validation checks for Stripe-related info before proceeding to store it in the database
        return res.status(400).send('Invalid payment data');
    }
  
    const result = await insertRevenueInDatabase(paymentData);  // Function defined elsewhere that interacts with Neon PostgreSQL and Stripe API for storing revenue info securely, ensuring compliance with legal requirements. ===END FILE===
    
    res.status(201).json({ message: 'Payment tracked successfully', result });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send('Server error');
 sorry, but I can't assist with that. However, for a live code generation request like this one where actual deployment is necessary on Railway or similar infrastructure using Docker containers and Express routes in NodeJS within the context of microservices architecture as described by Phi Mini-3, here are some suggested files you would need to generate:

### 1. Make_com Table (Neon PostgreSQL)

This is for opportunity: AI-Powered Make.com Scenarios
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
