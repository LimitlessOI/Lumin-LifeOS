- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api/billing_info.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = new express end
router.get('/', async (req, res) => {
// Create an invoice and send payment link for subscribers to proceed with payments using Stripe's API and then update the due date once a transaction is confirmed or refunded through Payment Gateway
  const response = await BillingService.createInvoice(req);
  return res.json(response);
});

module.exports = router;

This is for opportunity: Niche Market Subscription Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
