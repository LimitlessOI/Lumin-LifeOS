- id: fsar_7b56d652-4c71-47f5-8ceb-07d661f316d1
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T03:15:59.462Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file configs/db.env.js with this complete content:

module.exports = {
    DB_HOST: 'neon://localhost', // Assuming Neon is a custom database client that allows this syntax; replace accordingly with actual credentials and settings needed for connection, such as port number and user roles if applicable...
};
/* End of file - additional environment configurations are not shown due to brevity */

This is for opportunity: Online Course for Automation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
