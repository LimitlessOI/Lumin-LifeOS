- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.sql with this complete content:

module.exports = function(mongoose) {
    
    const UserSchema = mongoose.model('User', require('./models/user')); // Assume this model is defined elsewhere in the project for MongoDB interactions, if needed.

    apiRouter.get('/behavior-data/:userId/insights', async (req, res, next) => {
        const userId = req.params.userId;
        try {
            let insightsData = await UserSchema.find({_id: userId}).select('actions').lean().exec(); // Simplified example query using Mongoose for MongoDB interactions
            
            res.json(insightsData);
        } catch (error) {
            next(error);
        }
    });
    
    apiRouter.post('/behavior-data/:userId/actions', async (req, res, next) => {
        const userId = req.params.userId;
        
        try {
             // Assume this function calls the Neon AI Model Training Service and stores behavior data in your database after analysis 
            await analyzeAndStoreUserBehavior(req.body);
            responseMessage('Action recorded successfully');
        } catch (error) {
            next(error);
        }
    });
    
    // ... additional routes for other CRUD operations on User and BehaviorData models...
};

This is for opportunity: AI-Driven User Behavior Analysis
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
