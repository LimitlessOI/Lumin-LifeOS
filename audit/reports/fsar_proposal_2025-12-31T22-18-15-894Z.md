idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_4.js with this complete content:

// config/express-config.js ===START FILE===
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json()); // Enable JSON parsing for all requests to handle incoming data from Stripe or other APIs via Railway’s optional integration point with read + log operations, without autonomous charging being directly handled by developers as an execution queue system within the backend infrastructure framework developed using Express and Node.js technology stack inside Railway's robust-magic environment for our MVP startup development services business model leveraging AI enhancements in rapid prototyping capabilities with revenue capture mechanisms included.
app.use(express.static('public')); // Serve static assets, such as the React Native frontend bundled through Create React App or similar toolchain for cross-platform compatibility using Light Task engineers' workflows to integrate seamlessly within Railway’s robust execution queue system and maintain consistent user experience across different platforms via Express routes handling GET requests.
module.exports = app; // Exporting the configured express application instance as a module that can be required by our main server file in Railway for backend infrastructure setup, which orchestrates all API endpoints routing using Node's built-in 'http' library or similar to listen on an appropriate port within production environments and CI/CD pipelines.
// ===END FILE===

This is for opportunity: Startup MVP Development Services
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
