- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.css with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
// Assume Sequelize ORM has been set up for the User, Scenario, and Interaction models with necessary associations defined within those objects before this file is run.

router.post('/scenarios', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const scenario = await scenariosModel.create(req.body); // Replace 'scenariosModel' with the actual model from Sequelize ORM setup for Scenarios table
        return res.status(201).json(scenario);
    } catch (error) {
        return res.status(400).json({ message: error.message }); 
    end file===

This is for opportunity: Make.com Scenario Generation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
