idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_5.sql with this complete content:

---FILE:migrations/2019_10_30_144158_create_consultations_table.sql---
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS consultations (
    consultation_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INTEGER REFERENCES customers(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    service_type VARCHAR(255), -- Assuming this represents the type of automation solution discussed. Adjust as needed.
    duration INTERVAL NOT NULL,  -- Using PostgreSQL's interval data type for simplicity in handling durations.
    notes TEXT
);

This is for opportunity: Business Automation Consulting
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
