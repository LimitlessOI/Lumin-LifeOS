- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_7.js with this complete content:

**FILE:config/application_preload_package.rb (loading all necessary packages) - Call this before initializing your application to load required models, libraries etc.:**

This is for opportunity: Online Business Enhancement Package
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
