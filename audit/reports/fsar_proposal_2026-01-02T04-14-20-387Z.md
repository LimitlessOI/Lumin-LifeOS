- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS stages (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    description TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users_roles (
    user_id INT REFEREN0CES users(id) DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRABLE INPLACE, -- allowing deferrable foreign keys for rollback safety. Modify as needed if using MySQL/MariaDB: `ON DELETE CASCADE`.
    role_id INT REFERENCES roles(id) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT FK_users_roles_user FOREIGN KEY (user_id), -- assuming this is the foreign key to users table. 
);

This is for opportunity: Make.com Scenario Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
