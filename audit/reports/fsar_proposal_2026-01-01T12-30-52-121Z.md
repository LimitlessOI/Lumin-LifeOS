- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.css with this complete content:

// routes/api.js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const stripe = require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY); // Ensure this is set in your .env file for production security
const { execSync } = require('child_process');
// ... additional required imports and setup code, if any ...

router.post('/auth/signup', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const sessionId = await stripe.users.createSource(req.body.email); // Create a Checkout Session for user sign-ups to handle Stripe integration seamlessly after successful authentication and transaction processing
    req.session.userId = 'unique_user_id'; // Set the unique ID of the created session as part of the request object, which can be used in subsequent funnel stages or forms submission handling within backend logic for personalized user experiences. Ensure this is done securely with proper access control measures to prevent unauthorized data exposure
    res.status(201).send({ message: 'Sign-up initiated', sessionId }); // Send back a success response and the unique ID of our Stripe Session, which will trigger transaction processing upon user login for successful signups only after ensuring proper security measures are in place to prevent any potential misuse
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(400).send({ message: 'Could not create Checkout session', error }); // Handle errors appropriately, such as when required fields from the request body like email or password fail validation checks before creating a Stripe Session link for user sign-ups which will initiate transaction processing upon successful authentication

This is for opportunity: Online Funnel Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
