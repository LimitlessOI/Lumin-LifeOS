- timestamp: 2026-01-01T14:42:58.583Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file deployment/production_deployment.sh with this complete content:

#!/bin/bash
echo "Deploying the Code Review Service..."
cd /railway_code_review
npm install express body-parser pg dotenv stripe multer ejs nodemon --save
node app.js # or start your Express server here with desired configurations for production environment...

This is for opportunity: Rapid Code Review Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
