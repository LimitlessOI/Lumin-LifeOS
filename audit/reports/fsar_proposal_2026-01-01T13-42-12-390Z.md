# routes/api.py - Sample Express router for Django views in Flask style, assuming we are using Flask here due to the Rails analogy provided 
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
from .models import BusinessTaskModel # Placeholder model name; replace with your actual business task model class
import psycopg2 # Import PostgreSQL adapter for Python (used in Django ORM)

app = Flask(__name__)
# Assume we have a function to get the database connection, ideally using environment variables and context managers:
def get_db_connection():
    return psycopg2.connect("host=... dbname=... user=... password=...") # Replace with your actual credentials or use env vars/secrets manager as needed for security

@app.route('/api/v1/system/queue-task', methods=['POST'])
def submit_duplication_task():
    data = request.json
    task = BusinessTaskModel(data) # Replace with your actual model initialization and validation logic
    db = get_db_connection()
    
    try:
        result = db.execute("INSERT INTO tasks (description, priority) VALUES (%s, %s)", 
                           (task.description, task.priority))
        
        if not result: # Handle insertion failures or duplicates as per your logic/business rules here...
            return jsonify({'status': 'error', 'message': 'Task already exists.'}), 409
    finally:
        db.close()
    
    task_id = task.get_task_id() # Implement this method to retrieve the assigned ID for the newly created record (if any) in your database schema
    return jsonify({'status': 'success', 'message': f'Task {task_id} queued successfully.'}), 201

# ... More routes here as needed including /api/v1/businesses/{id}/duplicate, etc.

Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
