- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.sql with this complete content:

#### Database Schema & Migrations ####
_**Note: SQL and JSON files to be created below as per the schema described. Actual content should reflect proper syntax for Neon PostgreSQL with secure practices in mind._

### File 1: db.js ### (Migration Scripts) - This will contain functions written using `sequelize` or similar ORM tools available to interact with our customized Neon PostgreSQL schema, including CRUD operations for the specified tables and any necessary helper methods like fraud detection alert insertion into error logs table etc.

This is for opportunity: Stripe Integration Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
