CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS subscriptions (
    subscription_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    plan_id INTEGER REFERENCES plans(plan_id),
    start_date DATE NOT NULL,
    end_date DATE,
    price NUMERIC(10, 2) CHECK (price > 0),
    status VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT 'active',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT0TIMERSTAMP() ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
