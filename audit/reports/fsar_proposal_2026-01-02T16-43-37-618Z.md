- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_6.css with this complete content:

router.post('/api/v1/refund', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    await paymentController.processRefund(req.body); // Function to handle refund operations; see controller for details.
    return res.status(204).send();
  } catch (error) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Failed to process a refund' });
  })
});

This is for opportunity: Overlay Game Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
