import { gql, useSubscription } from '@apollo/client';

export const GET_USER_GAMES = gql`
  subscription onGameProgress(userId: String!, sessionId: ID!) {
    userGames(filter: { gameSessionId: $sessionId }, first: 10, orderBy: createdAt) {
      id
      username
      progress
      completedAchievementsCount
      incompleteAchievementsCount
    }
  }
`;

Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
