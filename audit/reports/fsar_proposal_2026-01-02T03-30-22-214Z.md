idea_implementation: Create or update the file db/migrate/20190730_create_users_table.sql with this complete content:

BEGIN TRANSA0;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(80) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    role ENUM('admin', 'user') DEFAULT 'user'
);
COMMIT TRANSA0;

This is for opportunity: Stripe Integration Consulting
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
