- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS content (
    course_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, -- Assuming each piece of curated learning material has a unique identifier for easy referencing and retrieval 
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    topic_area VARCHAR(100) CHECK (topic_area <> ''), -- Topic area specified to avoid null entries which are non-sensical within the content metadata context as suggested by user request. This is a simplistic check and could be expanded for more complex validations like uniqueness based on industry relevance
    difficulty VARCHAR(50),
    related_topics JSON[] -- Assumes use of PostgreSQL's native array type to store potentially multiple-related topic areas in one entry which can later facilitate AI curatorial logic using advanced machine learning algorithms (not shown) 
);

This is for opportunity: Subscription-Based Learning Platform
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
