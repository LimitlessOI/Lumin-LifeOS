- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_5.sql with this complete content:

*Please note that the above code snippets are illustrative and need further development based on full requirements. Functional endpoints should be fully defined to handle all aspects of user management and payment processing as per initial technical architecture plan.*

### Revenue Capture Mechanism Handling Code & Logic ###:
*Complete implementation will require additional files for functions like `create_or_retrieve_token`, handling the OAuth token creation/retrival, post-payment update logic etc. and full database migration SQL scripts to be written based on a detailed schema design.* 

The above code provides only an illustrative representation of how you might structure these files with Express Router routes for API endpoints managing Stripe integration alongwith OAuth token handling in nodejs, assuming that the necessary functions `create_or_retrieve_token` and `postPayment` are implemented elsewhere within your codebase or infrastructure.

*Please ensure to further expand on these snippets by providing detailed logic for each function/module as per actual business requirements.* 

===FILE:stripe-integration.js===

This is for opportunity: Stripe Integration Services
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
