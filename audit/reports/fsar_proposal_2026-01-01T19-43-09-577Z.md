# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_82815f55-2ce6-4097-b788-ad3d8d8204fc

- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file server/routes/api.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
require('dotenv').config(); // to load .env variables from Railway's sidecars if necessary
const { generateCode, getGenerationStatus, invoices } = require('../controllers/codeGeneratorController');
const billingService = require('../services/billingService'); 
// ... more required services and controllers as needed...

const router = express.Router();

router.post('/generate_code', generateCode); // Code Generation Endpoint with metadata return
router.get('/generate_status/:userID', getGenerationStatus); // Status of pending generation requests for a specific user
// Stripe and billing integration endpoint - read + logging only (mocked or external service) 
router.post('/billing/invoices', invoices, async (req, res) => { /* handle payment processing */ });

module.exports = router;

This is for opportunity: AI-Driven Code Generation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
