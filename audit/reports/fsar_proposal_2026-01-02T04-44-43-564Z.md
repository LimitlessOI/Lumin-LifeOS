- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.sql with this complete content:

-- Initial migration script to create the SaaS clone tables if they do not exist yet
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `cloned_saas_applications` (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    -- Other necessary fields like user permissions etc. here...
);

This is for opportunity: SaaS Cloning and Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
