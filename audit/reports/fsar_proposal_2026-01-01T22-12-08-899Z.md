- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file /api/migrations/001_create_tickets.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tickets (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(user_id), 
  subject VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITHO0KT ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH OZON, -- Assume 'WITH' was a typo and meant to be 'WITHOUT'.
  status ENUM('open', 'pending review', 'resolved') NOT NULL,  
);

This is for opportunity: Automated Customer Support Solutions
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
