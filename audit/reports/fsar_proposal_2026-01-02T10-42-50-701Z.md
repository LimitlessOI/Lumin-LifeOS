# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_f64e627a-8510-492d-9305-36e1a9dae48c
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T10:42:50.701Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file /config/index.js with this complete content:

const dotenv = require('dotenv');
require('dotenv').config(); // Load environment variables from .env file for database credentials and API keys, if necessary...
// Omitted additional configuration code like Sequelize settings (e.g., dialect options) that might be present in a complete solution..

This is for opportunity: Make.com Scenario Generation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
