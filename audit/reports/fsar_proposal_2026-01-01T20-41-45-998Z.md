- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/003_create_inventory_table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS inventory (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    product_id INTEGER REFERENCES products(id), -- Assume a 'products' table exists with relevant fields and relationships defined elsewhere for foreign key constraint to work properly
    quantity INT CHECK (quantity >= 0) DEFAULT 0,
    reorder_threshold INT NOT NULL CHECK (reorder_threshold > 0), -- A non-zero threshold indicates when an inventory refresh is needed.
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

This is for opportunity: Stripe Integration Enhancement
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
