# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_205cd221-31df-46f3-8475-117170f1b4af
- timestamp: 2025-12-31T23:35:02.474Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file stripe/index.js with this complete content:

require('dotenv').config(); // Ensure this is used in the actual deployment for sensitive data like secret keys
const stripe = require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET);
// ... Stripe integration setup, including handling payment webhooks...

This is for opportunity: Game Development for Overlay Distribution
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
