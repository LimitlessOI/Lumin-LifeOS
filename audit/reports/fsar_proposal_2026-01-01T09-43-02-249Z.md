- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_12.js with this complete content:

#### Integration and system level integration testing #### 
`integration_tests.js`: (Selenium WebDriver script to simulate user interactions with the web interface)

This is for opportunity: Automated Invoice Processing
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
