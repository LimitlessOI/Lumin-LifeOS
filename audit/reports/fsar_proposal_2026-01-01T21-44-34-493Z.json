This plan should be flexible enough for future expansion or contraction based on market demands without compromising security integrity. What are some of the best practices that can also aid me by keeping this system secure, scalable to handle thousands of users simultaneously, with potential growth anticipated? Certainly! To design a comprehensive deployment plan incorporating all these constraints and requirements for your web application while ensuring high performance under continuous scaling demands involves several steps. Here's an outline that covers the main components:\n\n### Technical Architecture ###\nThe technical architecture should leverage Docker containers to isolate different microservices, which can scale independently as per demand; these might include services for authentication (OAuth2), templates management/UI service with a React front-end component, and Stripe integration. Dependency injection will be used where necessary in the Node backend using Express.js framework:\n\n1. **Microservices Architecture** - Utilize Docker to containerize individual microservices such as authentication (OAuth2), template management/UI service, payment processing with Stripe API, and real-time analytics for monitoring revenue streams from subscriptions tied into the system's database schema through an ORM like Sequelize.\n\nThis is for opportunity: Subscription-based Business Templates\nMake sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.",
