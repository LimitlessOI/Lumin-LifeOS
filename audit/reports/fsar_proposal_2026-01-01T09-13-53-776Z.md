- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_6.css with this complete content:

require('dotenv').config();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
// ... other configuration settings based on the .env file...
module.exports = {PSQL_DB: 'your-database', NODE_ENV: 'production'}; // Example configurations exported for use in server and migration scripts.

This is for opportunity: AI-Driven User Behavior Analysis
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
