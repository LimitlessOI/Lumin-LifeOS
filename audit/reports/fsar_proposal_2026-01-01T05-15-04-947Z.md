- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.js with this complete content:

// models/User.js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true }, 
    password: String // TODO: add hashed passwords before saving and comparing against the database for authentication purposes (should not be stored in memory)
});

userSchema.methods.comparePassword = function(candidatePassword){
    return bcrypt.compareSync(candidatePassword, this.password); 
};

module.exports = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

This is for opportunity: Custom Make.com Scenarios
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
