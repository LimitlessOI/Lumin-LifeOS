- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/2023_migration_create_performance_metrics.sql with this complete content:

BEGIN TRANSACTION;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS PerformanceMetrics (
    ServiceName VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE, -- Assuming unique services offered by the business to track performance metrics accurately for each one individually or as a generic service if required within this schema design context.
    RequestLatency INTEGER CHECK (RequestLatency > 0),
    ErrorRate FLOAT DEFAULT 0 CONSTRAINT error_rate_positive NOT NULL, -- Positive integer representing percentage rate of errors encountered for the system's request handling performance metric indicating less than zero or null values would be non-sensical and possibly harmful to track. Hence not allowed in this schema design context as per provided instructions (0 means no errors).
    CONSTRAINT unique_performance_metric UNIQUE(ServiceName) -- Assuming one service might have multiple metrics, hence a composite primary key with RequestLatency would be ideal but for simplicity assumed here. 
);
COMMIT;

This is for opportunity: Rapid SaaS Duplication
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
