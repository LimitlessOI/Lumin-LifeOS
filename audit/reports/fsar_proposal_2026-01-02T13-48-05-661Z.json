  "proposal": "self_improvement:  To address the issues identified, we need to focus on several key areas to improve both functionality and performance of our system. Here are specific, actionable improvements that can be implemented to reduce friction in monetization flows, enhance ROI visibility, and maintain safety and ethics:\n\n### 1. Reducing Friction in Monetization Flows\n**Action:** Review and update the database schema to include necessary columns such as `ai_model` which was mistakenly omitted from the \"execution_tasks\" table. This will prevent future errors related to task execution due to missing data points.\n\n### 2. Improving ROI Visibility\n**Action:** Implement a more robust tracking system for Return on Investment (ROI). Instead of averaging durations, implement real-time or near-real-time metrics that can provide actionable insights into the performance of different ideas and services. This will involve integrating with Neon PostgreSQL to log detailed transactional data and analytics.\n\n### 3. Keeping Safety and Ethics Intact\n**Action:** Review current blind spot detection mechanisms for any biases or unethical practices in the AI models used. Implement regular audits and consider using external ethical guidelines to ensure compliance. Additionally, enhance user privacy settings and data protection measures within our system to prevent potential breaches of personal information.\n\n### 4. Code/Process Improvements\n**Action:** Streamline error handling mechanisms for task execution by implementing more comprehensive try-catch blocks around critical sections of the code. This will help in quickly identifying issues during runtime, allowing for prompt corrective action.\n\n**Action:** Implement a continuous integration and deployment pipeline to automate testing and deployment processes. This not only reduces manual intervention but also ensures that changes are consistently tested before being rolled out, which can lead to faster issue detection and resolution.\n\n### Implementation Steps:\n1. **Schema Update:** Begin by updating the database schema in Neon PostgreSQL to include `ai_model` column under \"execution_tasks\". This will require a migration script executed through our deployment pipeline.\n2. **ROI Tracking Improvement:** Develop a custom dashboard that visualizes detailed ROI metrics, integrating with Stripe APIs where applicable for real-time financial data. Use this data to make informed decisions about investment and service offerings.\n3. **Ethics Review:** Conduct an internal audit of AI models in use, including blind spot detection mechanisms. Update or replace any model that does not comply with safety and ethics guidelines.\n4. **Automated Testing and Deployment:** Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or similar tools to run automated tests whenever code is pushed to main branches. This will ensure that every change goes through a rigorous testing phase before deployment, minimizing the chance of introducing bugs or errors into production environments.\n\nThese improvements should help in enhancing the overall robustness and performance of our system while ensuring adherence to safety and ethical standards.",
