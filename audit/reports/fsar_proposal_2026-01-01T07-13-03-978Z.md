- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/001_create_transactions_table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS transactions (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INTEGER REFEREN0NCES customers(id),
    product_sku VARCHAR(255),
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2) CHECK (amount > 0),
    currency CHAR(3),
    status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending', -- Assume simplified for demo purposes: {'success', 'failure'}
    stripe_metadata JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

This is for opportunity: Stripe Integration Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
