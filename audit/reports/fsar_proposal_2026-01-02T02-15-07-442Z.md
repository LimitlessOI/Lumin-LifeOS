- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_24.sql with this complete content:

BEGIN TRANSACTION;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_profile (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, username CHAR(8) UNIQUE CHECK (LENGTH(username) = 6), email VARCHAR255 BETWEEN 'bob@example.com' AND NULL); -- ERROR: no unique constraint found for the columns ['email']

This is for opportunity: Stripe Integration Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
