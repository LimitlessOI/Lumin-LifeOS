- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, -- Using a primary key that auto-increments for each new user record in PostgreSQL with Neon extension library support as assumed based on Rails background context provided by the original document 
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    age INTEGER CHECK (age > 0 AND age <= 120), -- Assuming a reasonable constraint for ages to promote realistic profiles within professional learning platforms. This is an example and could be adjusted based on specific use case needs as indicated in the original plan document provided by user Phi-3 Mini
    industry_background VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    subscription_status BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE -- Default status set to false upon new account creation. This implies that users are not subscribed until they choose otherwise and fits within LifeOS policies for consent before billing 
);

This is for opportunity: Subscription-Based Learning Platform
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
