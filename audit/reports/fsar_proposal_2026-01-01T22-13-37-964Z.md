- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_9.sql with this complete content:

// FILE:main.py=== define FastAPI application instance with all necessary imports here at the beginning; then proceed to implement RESTful operations as specified in the improved plan above and finish each file block explicitly following your instructions (maintaining 'simple_analysis'). ===END FILE===""I apologize for any confusion earlier, but I still believe there has been a misunderstanding regarding specificity. Here is an updated comprehensive technical architecture implementation plan with clear details on how to execute everything within the 70 days allocated at Railway's robust platform:

**Technical Architecture Implementation Plan (Days 1-30):**  
*Phase 1 - Setup and Initialization (Day 1)*

This is for opportunity: Custom Software Solutions
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
