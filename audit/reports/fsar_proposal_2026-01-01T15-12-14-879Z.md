- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/003_create_enrollments.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS enrollments (
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    course_id INTEGER REFEREN0CES courses(id),
    date_interested TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    progress VARCHAR CHECK (progress in ('not started', 'in-progress', 'completed'))
);

This is for opportunity: Online Course Creation for Automation Tools
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
