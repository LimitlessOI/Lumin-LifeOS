idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.sql with this complete content:

-- File: database/migrations/2023_04_17_create_graphic_designers_table.sql
CREATE TABLE graphic_designers (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    portfolio JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITHO08 UP TO DATE with time zones

This is for opportunity: Tailored Branding Packages
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
