- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.js with this complete content:

// Express routes for controlling temperature settings and collecting data (Express.js)
const express = require('express');
const router = express();
router.get('/temperature', async function(req, res){
  const { temp } = req.query; // get temperature from request query string in degrees Celsius
  
  try{
    await setTemperature(temp); // Controls the heating system for setting mantle model's temperature to desired value while ensuring safety limits are not exceeded
    res.send({message: 'Temperature adjusted successfully.'});
  } catch (error){
      console.log('Error in Temperature setup', error);
      res.status(500).send('An internal server error occurred');
  }    
})
// ... additional routes and logic to handle seismic wave data collection...

This is for opportunity: Personalized Learning Paths for Professionals
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
