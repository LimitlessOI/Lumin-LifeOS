- id: fsar_ae232f60-65ad-4ae8-9f10-aea2bdb982a3
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T16:42:27.490Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/create_teams_table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS teams (
    team_name VARCHAR(100) PRIMARY KEY,
    team_leader_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    members_ids TEXT[] -- Using an array for simplicity; consider a separate junction table in production.
);

This is for opportunity: Remote Team Management Solutions
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
