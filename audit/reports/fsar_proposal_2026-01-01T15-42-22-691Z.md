- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS behavior_patterns (
    pattern_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, 
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(user_id), -- Establishing a foreign key relationship with 'users' table for relational integrity and to associate patterns.
    interaction_timestamp TIMESTAMP WIT0213_TIMESTAMP) DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, 
-- Other columns can be added as needed (contextual information like device type & location).

This is for opportunity: AI-driven User Modeling Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
