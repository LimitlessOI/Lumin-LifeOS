idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Courses (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    description TEXT,
    ai_generated_content TEXT, -- This column will store AI-generated content snippets for each course
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITHO0D WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WIT1D WITH TIMEZON DWITH TIME DOUBLE PRECISION DEFAULT 0.0 OUT OF NUmBERS SINCE EARLIER TO HELP ASSESS PROFITABILITY FOR ENROLLMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
    -- Additional fields as required for course metadata and progress tracking can be added here
);

This is for opportunity: Online Course Creation Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
