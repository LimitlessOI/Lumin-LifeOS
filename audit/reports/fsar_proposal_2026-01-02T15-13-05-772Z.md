- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS stripe_payments (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    amount DECIMAL(8,2), -- Amount in cents to ensure precision for small transactions without decimals.
    currency VARCHAR(3) DEFAULT 'usd', // Specify appropriate default based on your business requirements if necessary.
    payment_intent UUID NOT NULL UNIQUE, 
    status ENUM('created', 'paid') NOT NULL, -- Add more as required for different transaction states.
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITHOCTZ DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH (timezone) ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    processed_at TIMESTAMP NULLABLE -- For recording when the payment is actually processed.
);

This is for opportunity: Stripe Integration Consultation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
