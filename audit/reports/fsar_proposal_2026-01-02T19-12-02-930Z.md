idea_implementation: Create or update the file db/migrations/20191231_create_tasks_table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tasks (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    description TEXT,
    priority INTEGER CHECK(priority >= 0 AND priority <= 5), -- Example priorities: 1=Low, 5=High
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE,
    completed BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE
);

This is for opportunity: Make.com Automation Scenarios
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
