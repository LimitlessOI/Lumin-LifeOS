  "proposal": "idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_5.js with this complete content:\n\n#### Real-Time Feedback Loop & PID Control for Motor Speed Optimization:\nTo optimize and stabilize the speed of a DC motor, implement a Proportional–Integral–Derivative (PID) control loop directly in your code. The Arduino can be programmed to adjust pulse widths dynamically based on feedback from current sensors integrated into each circuit segment using analogRead().\n\n#### Minimizing Noise Interference: \nDesign the PWM signal paths with short traces and proper shielding techniques, utilize common-mode noise reduction methods such as twisted pair wiring or optoisolation. Since Fourier transform algorithms are not to be used directly in this context due to your constraints, we will discuss here how simple RC filters can mitigate electrical noise without resorting to complex mathematical computations:\n\nThis is for opportunity: Custom Automation Services\nMake sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.",
