- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_7.html with this complete content:

<div>Tasks for {{ employeeId }}</div> <!-- Replace 'employeeId' with actual dynamic value -->
<!-- Additional dashboard content goes here, including tabs or sections to display tasks and performance analytics graphs using AngularJS directives like ng-repeat or custom components where necessary -->

This is for opportunity: Remote Work Optimization Services
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
