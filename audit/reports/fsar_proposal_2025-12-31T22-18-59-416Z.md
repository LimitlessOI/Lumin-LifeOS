# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_d1c8470c-f764-472c-a680-31700d17bb68
- timestamp: 2025-12-31T22:18:59.416Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file revenue_capture/stripe.js with this complete content:

const stripe = require('@stripe/stripe-js')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET); // Assuming Stripe secret is securely managed via environment variables...
// ... setup event listeners and webhook processing as per the self-programmed endpoints, which should handle payment creation events with necessary data logging to Neon PostgreSQL for analytics purposes (this could also tie into your frontend if realtime dashboards are part of requirements)...

This is for opportunity: E-commerce AI Personalization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
