# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_aa57bedb-1aff-45f0-ae72-ead152b5992d
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T06:42:26.175Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api_example.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
// Import statements go here...
const router = new express.Router();
router.post('/submit-review', async function(req, res) { ... });  // Endpoint logic goes here with actual business processing and AI review feedback generation using the models specified in your plan above for sections #3 & #4.

This is for opportunity: Automated Code Review Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
