# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_f6e8b2c2-be49-46c4-970e-64be85cdcd65
- timestamp: 2025-12-31T22:51:35.892Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/userPreferencesApi.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
const { analyzeUserPreferences } = require('../models/analyticsService'); // Assuming a service that handles analytics and preferences logic is defined elsewhere in the codebase 
// ... complete file content with routes for CRUD operations on user preference data...

This is for opportunity: AI-driven User Preference Analytics
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
