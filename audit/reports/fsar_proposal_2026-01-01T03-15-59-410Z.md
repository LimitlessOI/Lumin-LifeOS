# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_1228aa0c-4a2a-4249-881a-9fff5d30cf50
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T03:15:59.410Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file components/CourseDashboard.js with this complete content:

import React from 'react'; // Assuming necessary imports are done above this code snippet here...
import './stylesheets/dashboard-materialize.css'; 

const CourseDashboard = () => { /* Logic to display course catalog with detailed descriptions and progress tracking indicators */ };
export default CourseDashboard; // Assume all necessary functional components are exported here for use in the larger application structure...

This is for opportunity: Online Course for Automation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
