You can set rate limits directly in the NGINX configuration or via annotations/sidecar injection, but this will require more complex configurations which are beyond simple template generation instructions; I'll provide guidance assuming you have Redis installed for session-based rate limiting:\n\nThis is for opportunity: QuickStart Automation Services\nMake sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.",
