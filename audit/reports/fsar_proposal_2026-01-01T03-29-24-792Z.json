  "proposal": "idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_6.js with this complete content:\n\n#### Stripe Integration Endpoints (Day 14-18) ####\nTo integrate with a service like Stripe without autonomous transactions would typically involve setting up APIs in Railway's `/api/v1` namespace to handle payment intents and charge creation endpoints, ensuring proper JWT token verification for secure access. This setup requires creating an actual Express route that constructs the necessary data payload following service-specific integration requirements with Stripe API (not provided here due to scope limitations but would typically include a POST endpoint `/api/v1/billing`, handling logic including formulating payment intent creation and retrieval requests, parsing responses from Stripe for user feedback).\n\nThis is for opportunity: Automation Strategy Consulting\nMake sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.",
