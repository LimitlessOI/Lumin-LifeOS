- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.sql with this complete content:

-- schema/users.sql - Create table for storing user data efficiently in Neon PostgreSQL database using transactional DDL commands with appropriate foreign keys, indices as required to optimize lookups and maintain referential integrity between tables like `user_snapshots` capturing snapshots of tool usage changes:

This is for opportunity: Enhanced Productivity Tools
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
