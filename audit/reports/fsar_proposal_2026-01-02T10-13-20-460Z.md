idea_implementation: Create or update the file k8s/deployment/dashboard_deployment.yml with this complete content:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: performance-analytics-dashboard
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: dashboard
  replicas: 3
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: dashboard
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: performance-analytics-dashboard
        image: railway/performance_analytics_dashboard # Hypothetical Railway Image for the Dashboard Container; not shown here as it's beyond this snippet and would involve setting up a Dockerfile, building images, pushing to your Kubernetes cluster.

This is for opportunity: Performance Analytics Dashboard
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
