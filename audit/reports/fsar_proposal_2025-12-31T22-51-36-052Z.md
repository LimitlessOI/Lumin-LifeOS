# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_e1e027e5-b19f-4612-845a-5cf5aa042d7c

- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file scripts/db-migrate.js with this complete content:

const knex = require('knex'); // Assuming Knex is used to interact with the database 
require('dotenv').config();                   // Load environment variables from .env file for production security and configuration
// Setup connection string using DATABASE_URL variable defined in config/.env.
knexify(process.env.DATABASE_URL, async (err) => {
    if (!err && await knex.schema.hasTable('user_preference_analytics')) console.log("Tables created successfully!"); 
});

This is for opportunity: AI-driven User Preference Analytics
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
