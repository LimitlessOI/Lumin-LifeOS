# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_4e50b6b4-40b5-4338-bc78-c98b36893e8c
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T11:12:36.648Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/2bonus_create_overlays_junction_table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS usergameplay (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    game_id INTEGER REFERENCES games(game_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    overlay_id INTEGER REFERENCES overlays(overlay_id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT (clock_timestamp() - interval '1 second') NOT NULL
);

This is for opportunity: Game Overlay Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
