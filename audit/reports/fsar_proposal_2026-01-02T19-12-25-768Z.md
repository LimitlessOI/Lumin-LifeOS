- id: fsar_b9b55e69-8365-43e0-9642-8c0d675ffa10

- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_4.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
require('dotenv').config(); // To handle environment variables for secret keys not shown here but essential in production settings.
const router = new express.Router();
const Stripe = require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET); 
// Assume 'Stripe' is the configured stripe instance with proper error handling and logic for processing payments, not shown here but essential in production settings) end file===

This is for opportunity: Make.com Scenario Generation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
