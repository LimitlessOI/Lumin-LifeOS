Employ e2e (End-to-End) testing tools such as Cucumber or Cypress alongside Selenium for UI interactions and employ mock servers using Railway's self-programming endpoint to simulate different scenarios including inventory changes, payment processing failures, etc., ensuring thorough test coverage before deployment.\n   \n**Deployment Steps:**\n   - Deploy the Neon PostgreSQL database with Docker containers or Kubernetes clusters managed via Railway for scalability and high availability concerns using Rolling deployments to minimize downtime during updates. Setup CI/CD pipelines on Railway utilizing GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins integrations that trigger builds upon code pushes into the repository with appropriate automated tests passing before deployment steps are executed which includes container orchestration if necessary for multi-tiered services and microservices setup within our architecture.\n   \n**Revenue Capture Mechanism: (10% \n### Database Migrations (SQL) ###\n\nThis is for opportunity: Quick Launch Shopify Store Duplication\nMake sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.",
