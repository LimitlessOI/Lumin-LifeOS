# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_518620db-1767-465a-9f7a-7610c8240835
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T00:41:43.546Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file components/Dashboard.js with this complete content:

import React from 'react';
// ... other necessary imports...

const Dashboard = ({ userData }) => {
    // Component logic to display dashboard with progress and learning content goes here...
};

export default Dashboard;

This is for opportunity: Personalized Learning Systems
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
