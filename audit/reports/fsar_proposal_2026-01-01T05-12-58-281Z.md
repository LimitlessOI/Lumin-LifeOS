# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_d9cecf7d-a786-414b-8842-c2a5a407aab5
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T05:12:58.281Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const { checkUrgencyLevel, getClients, createClient, updateAutomationTask } = require('./controllers/clientAndTasksController');
// ... complete file content with necessary routes and controller functions...

This is for opportunity: Make.com Automation Scenario Design
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
