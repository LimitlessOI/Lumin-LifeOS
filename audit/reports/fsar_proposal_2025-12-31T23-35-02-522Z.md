# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_84fc191f-8b6f-4fcb-8284-8ec53ff2f4a4
- timestamp: 2025-12-31T23:35:02.522Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file frontend/overlayComponents.js with this complete content:

import React from 'react';
// ... necessary imports for state management and other functionalities...
export const OverlayComponent = () => {
    // Component logic here (if needed)
};
/* This component would interact with the server-side API via AJAX calls, managed by Redux in a typical frontend setup. */

This is for opportunity: Game Development for Overlay Distribution
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
