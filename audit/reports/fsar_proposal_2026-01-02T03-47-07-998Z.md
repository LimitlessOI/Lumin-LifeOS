- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
const { createCourse, getEnhancedInteractivityCourses } = require('../controllers/coursesController');
const stripe = require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY);

// POST to register a user
router.post('/register', async (req, res) => {
    // Registration logic using light_tasks for fast processing goes here
});

// GET all enhanced interactivity courses
router.get('/enhanced-interactivity/courses', createEnhancedInteractivityCourseEndpoint);

function createEnhancedInteractivityCourseEndpoint(req, res) {
    // Endpoint logic to filter and return only 'Enhanced Interactivity' category courses goes here using Stripe API for secure transactions where needed.
}

// POST to process a payment with stripe integration (only when the course is related to enhanced interactivity content).
router.post('/payment/process_with_stripe', async (req, res) => {
    // Integration logic using Stripe API goes here for processing payments and storing necessary transaction details in interactions log table.
});

// Other CRUD endpoints related to courses, instructors, course materials go here... 

module.exports = router;

This is for opportunity: Online Learning Platform Enhancement
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
