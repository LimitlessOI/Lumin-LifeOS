  "proposal": "idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.sql with this complete content:\n\n// migrations/001_create_table.sql - SQL migration for creating necessary tables like `users`,`orders`, and related ones in Neon PostgreSQL database (simplified example) with foreign keys to maintain integrity between orders and users, etc., which should include all other required fields as per business requirements\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS \"public\".\"customers\" (\"id\" SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT NOT NULL, email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL); -- Simplified creation of customer table with a unique identifier for each user (customer). The actual schema will be more complex and should include additional fields like `phone`, `address` etc. as per requirements\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS \"public\".\"orders\" (\"id\" SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, customer_id INTEGER REFERENCES public.customers ON DELETE CASCADE, status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL CHECK (status IN ('created', 'processing', 'paid', 'cancelled')), total NUMERIC, payment_method TEXT); -- Simplified creation of orders table with reference to the customers and storing necessary fields like order `total`, current `status` etc.\n-- Additional foreign keys related tables would need similar structure for maintaining integrity in relationships between entities (like linking payments/refunds specifically). These should be designed according to precise business logic specifications provided separately or standardized patterns as per Neon PostgreSQL documentation and best practices, not displayed here due to brevity.\n\nThis is for opportunity: Custom Stripe Integration Service\nMake sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.",
