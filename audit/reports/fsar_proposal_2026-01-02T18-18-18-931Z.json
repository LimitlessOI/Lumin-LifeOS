  "proposal": "self_improvement:  To address the identified issues and improve our system's performance and reliability, we should focus on several key areas:\n\n1. **Codebase Maintenance:**\n   - Ensure all database tables have proper columns by updating the `execution_tasks` table to include the missing `ai_model` column. This will prevent future task execution failures due to schema inconsistencies.\n   - Implement robust error handling and logging for tasks that fail, providing detailed insights into why they failed (`ai_model` being a crucial piece of information in this case).\n\n2. **Performance Optimization:**\n   - Review the average duration spent on different types of activities (implementing ideas, executing ideas, self-improvement) and optimize processes where necessary.\n   - Implement asynchronous task processing to reduce response times for tasks that involve complex computations or external API calls. This can be achieved using technologies like Celery or Kafka with a message broker such as Redis.\n\n3. **Monetization Flows:**\n   - Enhance the Stripe integration by adding more detailed logging of transactions and revenue streams. This will not only improve ROI visibility but also provide better financial tracking for decision-making.\n   - Implement A/B testing or other user experience research methods to optimize monetization strategies, ensuring that they remain both effective and ethically aligned with our service offerings.\n\n4. **Ethical and Safety Practices:**\n   - Regularly review and update the AI models and algorithms used in task execution to ensure compliance with ethical guidelines and safety standards. This includes conducting regular audits of model outputs for biases or unintended consequences.\n   - Strengthen user privacy protections by implementing stronger data encryption, anonymization techniques, and transparent information collection policies.\n\n5. **Long-term Development:**\n   - Invest in a more efficient database schema design that can scale with the growth of tasks and data without sacrificing performance.\n   - Implement predictive analytics to forecast potential issues or bottlenecks before they become critical.\n\n6. **Continuous Learning and Improvement:**\n   - Encourage a culture of continuous learning within the team, particularly in areas related to AI ethics, compliance, and best practices for software development.\n   - Set up regular hackathons or innovation days where teams can brainstorm new ideas and solutions to improve existing processes and technologies.\n\nBy focusing on these specific improvements, we can reduce friction in monetization flows, enhance ROI visibility, and maintain high standards of safety and ethics within our system.",
