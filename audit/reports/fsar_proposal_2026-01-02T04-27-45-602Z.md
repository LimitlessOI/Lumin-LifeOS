# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_9d788f6c-b094-4aae-8ae5-a07c9a439f36

- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file components/LoginForm.js with this complete content:

{
    "type": "functional component", // Or if you're implementing in TypeScript, use the appropriate interface here for props to maintain state management (local or Redux).
    
    "properties": {
        "onSubmit": function(event) { /* handle login submission event and dispatch a corresponding action */ } 
        // Implement OAuth2 authentication flow within this method. Use axios with proper headers, redirecting to Stripe for payment if necessary in the future when implementing payments autonomously after optional features like 'native Card Charge'. For now only handle login submission as needed without actual charging logic. 
    }
}

This is for opportunity: Game Development Overlay Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
