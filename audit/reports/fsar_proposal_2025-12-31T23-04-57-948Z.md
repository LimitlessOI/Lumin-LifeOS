- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file configurations/serverConfig.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors'); // For optional Stripe integration; not directly related to the AI-SEO service but useful for setting up CORS policies on our endpoints which are publicly accessible and would interact with external services like stripe in a real scenario. This code is provided here as an example of such configurations (not full implementation).
const app = express(); // Assuming Railway's environment setup, this file should contain the necessary server configuration settings for handling requests efficiently on microservices architecture which might include load balancing or similar advanced techniques but are beyond scope and plan specifications. Mocked with direct instantiation here to focus purely on backend logic without delving into actual configurations like cluster setups in Railway's robust-magic environment as of my knowledge cutoff date, 2023-04:
app.use(cors()); // Enable CORS for all routes and origins if needed; this is a simplification here just to illustrate the implementation conceptually without going into specific configurations that might be in Railway's robust setup as per plan provided by Phi-3 Mini (Local). 
module.exports = app;

This is for opportunity: AI-Powered SEO Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
