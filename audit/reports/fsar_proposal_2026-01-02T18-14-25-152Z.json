However, I will craft an example in GoLang because of its efficiency and ability to handle concurrency with goroutines. Please note this is a simplified representation assuming the use of Gorilla Mux as our web framework:\n\n**`models/CustomerProfile.go`:** This file contains structs for Customer Profile including age groups, gender preferences (using enums), payment methods in JSON format to simplify future integration with Stripe API endpoints and other services if needed.\n\nThis is for opportunity: Custom Automation Services\nMake sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.",
