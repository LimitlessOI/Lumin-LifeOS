- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.css with this complete content:

// File: config/dbConfig.js (Database configuration)
require('dotenv').config(); // Make sure Dotenv is installed via npm first...
const { DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD } = process.env;
module.exports = { dbUrl: `postgres://${DB_USER}:${DB_PASSWORD}@localhost/mydb` };

This is for opportunity: Freelance Platform for Developers
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
