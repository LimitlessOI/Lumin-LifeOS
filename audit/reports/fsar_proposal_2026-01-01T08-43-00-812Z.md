CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sales (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    productName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL CHECK (productName ~* '^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]+\b'),
    price NUMERIC(8,2) CHECK (price > 0),
    quantitySold INTEGER DEFAULT 0 CHECK (quantitySold >= 0) NOT NULL,
    userId INT REFERENCES users(id),

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
