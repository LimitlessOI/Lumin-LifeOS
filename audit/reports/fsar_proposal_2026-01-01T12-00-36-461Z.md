idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.js with this complete content:

const request = require('supertest');
const app = require('express')();
const stripeConfig = require('../config/stripe_config');
app.use('/api', new api()); // Assuming this is the middleware to set up your express routes for Stripe integration

describe('GET /income-snapshots endpoint', () => {
    it('should return a snapshot of revenue data from Neon PostgreSQL database through Stripe API', async () => {
        const response = await request(app).get('/api/v1/income_snapshots');
        
        expect(response.statusCode).toBe(200);
        // Additional assertions based on the expected structure of income snapshots in JSON format go here 
    });
});

This is for opportunity: AI-Driven Business Consultancy
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
