- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_5.js with this complete content:

#### Step 5: Create a Kubernetes Secret or ConfigMap for the Redis credentials, if applicable. This is essential to securely store sensitive data like passwords but remember not all caching systems require external storage of such details and can be configured directly in NGINX configs/secrets as environment variables (or similar mechanisms).

This is for opportunity: QuickStart Automation Services
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
