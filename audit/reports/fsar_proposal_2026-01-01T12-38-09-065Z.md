idea_implementation: Implement: [object Object]

Impact: medium (9.0/10 rating)
Revenue: high
Difficulty: hard
Priority: medium

Existing solutions: [{"name":"Surge Pricing","description":"Many ride-sharing and delivery services use surge pricing to increase prices during high demand periods."},{"name":"Upselling Techniques","description":"Companies may offer premium or add-on services at higher costs, attempting to maximize revenue per customer based on perceived willingness to pay more for enhanced service levels."}]

Best approach: [object Object]

Think outside the box. Consider unintended consequences.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
