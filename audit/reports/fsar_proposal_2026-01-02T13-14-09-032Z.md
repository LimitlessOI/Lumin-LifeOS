- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/2023_migration_create_user_accounts.sql with this complete content:

BEGIN TRANSACTION;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS UserAccount (
    UserID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, -- Ensuring each user has a unique identifier for efficient processing and security purposes in real-time operations on Railway platform.
    Email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL CHECK (Email LIKE '%@%.%' AND LENGTH(REGEXP_REPLACE(Email, '[._]', '', 'g')) <= 3), -- Validating email format using REGEX to conform with standard requirements.
    PasswordHash CHAR(64) -- Assuming the use of bcrypt for hashing passwords as per modern security practices and Railway platform's standards which typically require secure password storage mechanisms in place before deployment on a production environment, including Kubernetes orchestration if necessary. 
);
COMMIT;

This is for opportunity: Rapid SaaS Duplication
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
