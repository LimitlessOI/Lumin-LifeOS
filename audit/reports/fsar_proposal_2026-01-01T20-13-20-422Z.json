Adjust based on actual application requirements and schema definitions for 'User' considering best practices in security regarding password storage:\n  offer: /* full prisma model definition including field types as necessary */ -- Placeholder comment indicating where Prisma Offer Model would be defined with appropriate fields (e.g., title, description, price) based on business logic and schema definitions for 'Offer', adjusting according to actual application requirements such as nested structures if applicable:\n};\n\nThis is for opportunity: Quick Start Online Income Funnels\nMake sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.",
