idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_7.js with this complete content:

def train_neural_network(X, y):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        ...layers here...
    ])
  
model.compile(...) # Compile the neural network with appropriate loss and optimizer:

This is for opportunity: E-commerce Funnel Enhancement
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
