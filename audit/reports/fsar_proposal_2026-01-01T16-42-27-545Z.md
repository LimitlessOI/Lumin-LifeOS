- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/create_tasks_table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tasks (
    task_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    description VARCHAR(500),
    assigned_to_user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    due_date DATE NOT NULL
);

This is for opportunity: Remote Team Management Solutions
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
