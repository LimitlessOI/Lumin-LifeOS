idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
// Other imports... 

const router = new Router();

router.post('/chatbot/start_conversation', async (req, res) => {
    // Start a conversation logic here using FastAPI framework and Celery tasks for backend asynchrony in handling chat sessions efficiently within Railway environment which is assumed to be running this codebase. 
    const startConversation = require('../controllers/start_conversation'); // This would contain the actual function that starts a conversation, possibly using FastAPI's dependency injection system for user details and context gathering (not fully implemented here).
    
    await startConversation(req.body); 
    res.status(200).json({ message: 'Conversation started!' });
});

router.get('/knowledge_base/:id', async (req, res) => {
    // Logic to fetch knowledge base articles linked for reference or context during support conversations based on specific keywords in users’ queries using Neon PostgreSQL database interaction with environment variables and proper error handling as per our monitoring specialty criteria. 
});

router.post('/chatbot/end_conversation', async (req, res) => {
    // End conversation logic including logging to the tickets table in `users` schema using Neon PostgreSQL ORM techniques for database interactions with error handling as per our monitoring specialty criteria . 
});

router.post('/self-program/train_model', async (req, res) => {
    // Endpoint logic here to incorporate self-programming through continuous learning from interaction data and text generation services like OpenAI API or similar for AI understanding as per our 'light_tasks' specialty criteria . 
});

router.get('/health', async (req, res) => {
    // Health check endpoint logic here to ensure system is up-and-running with proper status messages and any additional metrics logging required in keeping with the monitoring strategy as per our 'monitoring' specialty criteria . 
});

router.get('/api/v1', async (req, res) => {
    // Basic express routing logic to serve API documentation or health check endpoints if needed for development and testing purposes within Railway environment which is assumed to be running this codebase as part of our 'self-program' specialty criteria . 
});

This is for opportunity: AI-Enhanced Customer Support Chatbots
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
