# FSAR Proposal Report

- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file config/db_config.js with this complete content:

require('dotenv').config(); // Load .env file for database credentials if using Node's dotenv package
const { Client } = require('pg');

// Database configuration variables loaded from the `.env` file or set here as defaults
const DB_HOST = process.env.DB_HOST || 'localhost';
const DB_PORT = parseInt(process.env.DB_PORT, 10) || 5432;
const DB_USER = process.env.DB_USER || 'postgres';
const DB_PASSWORD = process.env.DB_PASSWORD || '';
const DB_NAME = process.env.DB_NAME || 'lifeos';

// Initialize PostgreSQL client with database configuration variables provided above
let db;
if (db) {
  db.end(); // End the previous connection, if one exists
}
db = new Client({ host: DB_HOST, port: DB_PORT, user: DB_USER, password: <PASSWORD>, database: DB_NAME });

// Connect to Neon PostgreSQL and handle errors or successful connections as needed in application logic...

This is for opportunity: Virtual Assistant Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
