- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(255),
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255),
    status ENUM('active', 'inactive') DEFAULT 'active' -- assuming the new requirement for a custom enum-like type handling active/inactive states. Assuming PostgreSQL; modify as needed if using MySQL or another DBMS:
);

This is for opportunity: Make.com Scenario Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
