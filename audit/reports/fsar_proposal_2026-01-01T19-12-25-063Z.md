idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.sql with this complete content:

// ChatInteractionService.js - Service layer for initiating chatbot interactions (simplified)
const fs = require('fs');

class ChatInteractionService {
    static async startConversation(data) {
        // Placeholder logic to simulate starting a conversation with the AI bot; actual implementation would involve more complex interaction tracking and logging, especially after Stripe integration setup (phase 5 details not included in this plan as per current scope). For now we will just return success.
        
        const logEntry = {
            InteractionID: uuidv4(), // Using UUID v4 for simplicity; actual implementation would require proper logging mechanism to write these entries into the database schema designed in phase 1 and beyond Phase 5, which isn't implemented here yet as it is outside of our current scope.
            Timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
            DataReceived: JSON.stringify(data) // Example data received from POST request body to simulate passing user input or requests through the API endpoint
        };
        
        fs.appendFileSync('logs/interactions_log.json', `${JSON.stringify(logEntry)}\n`);
        
        return { success: true, InteractionID: logEntry.InteractionID }; // In a real scenario this would be replaced with the appropriate database insert operation and response structure after Stripe integration setup in phase 5.
    }
}
module.exports = ChatInteractionService;

This is for opportunity: Custom AI Chatbot Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
