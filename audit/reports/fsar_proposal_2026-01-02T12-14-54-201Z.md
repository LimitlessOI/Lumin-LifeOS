# FSAR Proposal Report

- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const fetch = require('node-fetch'); // Example of a non-blocking HTTP request library.
const { runAsSuperManager } = require('./utils/roles');
const stripePromise = require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY); 
// Assume that the Stripe integration requires a promise-based approach for asynchronous handling, which Node doesn't natively support like Ruby or Rails but can be achieved using third-party libraries as depicted in this pseudocode example:
app.get('/createOverlay', async (req, res) => {
  runAsSuperManager(req.user); // This function ensures only users with 'super_manager' role have access to the endpoint for creating overlays. It would use Devise or a similar gem in Rails instead of this utility method written here.
  
  try {
    const response = await stripePromise.createPaymentIntent({ amount: req.query.amount }); // Payment intent creation without actual transfer (hypothetical).
    
    res.json({ successMessage: 'Overlay submission successful!' });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    res.status(500).send('Server error');
  }
});

This is for opportunity: Game Overlay Distribution Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
