### Test Strategy ###

For testing the service, write automated tests using Jest or Mocha for backend endpoints and utilize tools like Cypress (for frontend interaction) to simulate user actions:
- Use Sequelize's CLI tool `npx sequelize-cli db:seed` to populate your PostgreSQL database with test data before running integration tests.
- Write unit tests using Jest for each independent function/endpoint, ensuring that they are tested in isolation and mocking external dependencies like the Stripe API where necessary.
- Create end-to-end or e2e tests to simulate a real user interaction flow with Cypress (or similar), testing both frontend components if present as well as their interactions with backend services, ensuring that all workflows are tested together in an integrated fashion including the revenue capture mechanisms and billing logic.

### Deployment Steps ###

For deployment on Railway:
1. Set up Docker containers using a `Dockerfile` containing your Node/Express app as well as any necessary service images like Stripe's for webhooks, if needed outside of Express itself (for example with Kong or directly via the appropriate API methods). 
2. Create environment configuration files (`docker-compose.yml`) to define how these containers will interact and communicate on Railway using their native networking capabilities which mimic a production setup as closely as possible while respecting Rails' specifications for webhook integration (e.g., Stripe IP/port bindings).
3. Write `kong:api` or similar Kong plugins to handle the communication with your Express API endpoints and ensure that they are correctly exposed via Kong, handling any CORS issues as per Railway’s documentation on working with external APIs in Kubernetes-native environments like Railway.
4. Push all Docker images along with configuration files (like `.env`, `Dockerfile`, etc.) to the Railway repository using their container registry integration for deployment:

Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
