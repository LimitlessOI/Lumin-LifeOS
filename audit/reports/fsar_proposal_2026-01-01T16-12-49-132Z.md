idea_implementation: Create or update the file db/migrate/2023_migration_create_consultations_table.sql with this complete content:

BEGIN TRANSA0DITION;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS consultations (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    business_id INTEGER REFERENCES businesses(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    completed BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
    assigned INTEGER REFERENCES users(id), -- Assuming there is a 'users' table for assigning consultations to specialists.
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
COMMIT;

This is for opportunity: Automation Workflow Consulting
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
