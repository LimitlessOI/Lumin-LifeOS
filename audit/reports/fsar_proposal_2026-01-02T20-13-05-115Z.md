idea_implementation: Create or update the file models/users.rb with this complete content:

class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :scenarios
  has_many :tasks, through: :scenarios
  
  # Additional fields for user preferences and automation scenario libraries can be added here as needed.

Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
