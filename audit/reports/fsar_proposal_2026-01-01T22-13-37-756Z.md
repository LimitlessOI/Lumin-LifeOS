- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_5.js with this complete content:

**API Endpoints:**  
Develop RESTful endpoints using FastAPI within Railway for listing, creating and updating projects; managing task queues with creation logic that allows dynamic reorder based on project needs. Implement an endpoint `/api/v1/income` to log Stripe transactions by triggering webhooks without performing charges directly (maintaining 'client_management').

This is for opportunity: Custom Software Solutions
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
