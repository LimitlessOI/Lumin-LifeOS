idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.css with this complete content:

// Startup.js ===START FILE===
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

let startupSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    industry: String,
    size: String, // Size of the company (e.g., small, medium, large)
    developerIdRef: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Developer' } // Reference to associated developers using Mongoose ObjectIDs linking between startups and their respective development teams via Express routes that handle CRUD operations on the Startup Model within Railway’s Neon PostgreSQL database snapshots for high market demand efficiency analysis by AI Monitor.
});

const DeveloperSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    role: String, // Role in development (e.g., Project Manager, Design Lead)
    startupIdRef: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Startup' } // Reference to associated startups via Express routes that handle CRUD operations on the Developer Model within Railway’s Neon PostgreSQL database snapshots for high market demand efficiency analysis by AI Monitor
});

const StartupModel = mongoose.model('Startup', startupSchema);
const DeveloperModel = mongoose.model('Developer', DeveloperSchema);
module.exports = { StartupModel, DeveloperModel };
// ===END FILE===

This is for opportunity: Startup MVP Development Services
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
