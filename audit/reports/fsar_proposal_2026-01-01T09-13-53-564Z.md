idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.css with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
require('dotenv').config();
const apiRouter = require('./routes/api')(mongoose); // Assume mongoose is set up elsewhere in your project for MongoDB interactions. 

// Initialize Express and configure it with the routes from 'routes' directory.
const app = express();
app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use('/api', apiRouter);

app.listen((process.env.PORT || 3000), () => {
    console01('Server started on port: %d', process.env.PORT || 3000);
});

This is for opportunity: AI-Driven User Behavior Analysis
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
