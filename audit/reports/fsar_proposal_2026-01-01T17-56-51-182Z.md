# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_3f18470c-6676-4941-b777-7c2f28890a4c

- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file models/task.js with this complete content:

const { Model, DataTypes } = require('sequelize');
module.exports = (sequelize) => {
  const Task = sequelize.define("Task", {
    id: {
      type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
      autoIncrement: true,
      primaryKey: true
    },
    description: DataTypes.TEXT,
    status: {
      type: DataTypes.STRING,
      defaultValue: "PENDING" // Assume we have 'PENDING', 'COMPLETED' and other possible states for tasks
    }
  });
  
  return Task;
};

This is for opportunity: Automation Workflow Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
