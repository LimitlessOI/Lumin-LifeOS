- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file kong_config/lightweight_assistant.yml with this complete content:

route:
  type: live-service
  nodes: ["railways"] # Railway backend service hostname or IP address with a port number if needed, for example "api.trainingscouncil":443
  plugins: [# list of necessary Kong plugins here ]
  routes: [{method: GET, path: "/api/v1/auth/register", plugin_configs: {}}] # Register endpoint configuration with OAuth2 or OpenID Connect setup if needed. Add other endpoints similarly...

This is for opportunity: Code Review Express
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
