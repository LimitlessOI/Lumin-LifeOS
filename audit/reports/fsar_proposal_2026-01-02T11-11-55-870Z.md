- timestamp: 2026-01-02T11:11:55.870Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.js with this complete content:

// File: routes/api.js (Express Router setups) ===END FILE===
const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();

router.get('/overlays', async (req, res) => {
    // Fetch overlays from the database and send back as JSON response
});

router.post('/interactions/create', async (req, res) => {
    // Record user interaction with an overlay into the interactions table in Neon PostgreSQL DB
});

module.exports = router;

This is for opportunity: LifeOS Game Overlay Platform
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
