  "proposal": "self_improvement:  To address the issues identified, we need to focus on several key areas: resolving the current errors related to the missing `ai_model` column in the `execution_tasks` table, optimizing performance bottlenecks, and enhancing our blind spot detection mechanisms. Here are specific, actionable improvements:\n\n### 1. Resolving Errors Related to Missing Column (`ai_model`)\n**Issue:** The errors indicate that the `ai_model` column is missing from the `execution_tasks` table. This could be due to a database migration issue or an oversight during schema updates.\n\n**Actionable Improvement:**\n- **Revert and Correct Migration:** Revert the last few migrations that might have caused this issue, then manually create a new migration script to add the missing `ai_model` column. Ensure thorough testing before deploying any changes.\n- **Automated Checks:** Implement automated checks during deployment pipelines to verify if critical columns like `ai_model` exist in all relevant tables. If not, halt the deployment until the issue is resolved.\n\n### 2. Optimizing Performance Bottlenecks\n**Issue:** The performance bottlenecks are primarily in implementation and self-improvement phases, with durations significantly higher than average.\n\n**Actionable Improvement:**\n- **Code Profiling:** Implement code profiling tools to identify which parts of the codebase are consuming the most resources or taking the longest time to execute. Focus on optimizing these areas first.\n- **Algorithm Refinement:** Review and refine algorithms used for tasks like ROI tracking, blind spot detection, and implementation ideas. Look into more efficient data structures, parallel processing, and caching mechanisms.\n- **Database Optimization:** Ensure that database queries are optimized by using indexes where appropriate and avoiding unnecessary joins. Consider sharding or partitioning the database if it helps manage performance better under heavy loads.\n\n### 3. Enhancing Blind Spot Detection\n**Issue:** The detection of blind spots has increased significantly over a baseline, indicating potential issues in data collection or processing.\n\n**Actionable Improvement:**\n- **Expand Data Sources:** Integrate additional sensors or data streams that might provide more comprehensive coverage for detecting blind spots.\n- **Machine Learning Enhancement:** Train machine learning models to predict and identify blind spots more accurately by analyzing patterns across different datasets and user interactions.\n- **User Feedback Loop:** Implement a mechanism where users can report areas they perceive as blind spots, which can then be used to update the system's understanding of its operational boundaries.\n\n### 4. Reducing Friction in Monetization Flows\n**Issue:** There might be hidden fees or unclear steps that deter users from engaging with monetization flows.\n\n**Actionable Improvement:**\n- **Transparency Reporting:** Make all fee structures clear and upfront, including any potential transaction costs to the end user. Implement a transparent billing system where users can see detailed breakdowns of charges.\n- **User Education:** Provide comprehensive guides and tutorials for using the monetization features, addressing common questions or concerns that might lead to abandonment during the checkout process.\n\n### 5. Improving ROI Visibility\n**Issue:** The average duration for implementing ideas related to ROI tracking is significantly high, which could indicate a lack of efficiency in data processing or reporting mechanisms.\n\n**Actionable Improvement:**\n- **Real-Time Reporting Tools:** Implement real-time dashboards that display key performance indicators and ROI metrics directly from the database. This will help in faster decision-making and continuous monitoring.\n- **Automated Data Processing:** Streamline processes for data aggregation and processing to reduce lag between actions taken by AI models and their impact reflected in ROI figures.\n\nBy focusing on these improvements, we can not only fix current issues but also enhance the robustness and efficiency of our system across all operational fronts.",
