- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

router.post('/model-train', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        // Handle validation and creation of a new model...
        const responseData = await createModel(req.body);
        return res.status(201).send({ message: 'Successful request! Model with ID:' + responseData.id }); 
    } catch (error) {
        // Handle errors in creating or processing the model training...
   0;  
}

This is for opportunity: Custom AI Model Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
