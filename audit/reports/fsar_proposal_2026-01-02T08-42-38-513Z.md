idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.sql with this complete content:

-- File: migrations/001_create_tables.sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ScenarioTemplates (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    template TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Sales (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INTEGER REFERENCES Customers(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    revenue NUMERIC CHECK (revenue >= 0),
    transaction_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    -- Include any other necessary fields here.
);

This is for opportunity: Make.com Scenario Generation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
