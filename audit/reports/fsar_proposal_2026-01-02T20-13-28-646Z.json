This step assumes that you've completed development of all necessary files as outlined above before finalizing deployment steps on Day 22-30 within the timeline plan:\n\n```bash\n# Assuming a docker-compose setup is in place, run this to deploy your Railway container(s) and start services. Replace `your_railway_service` with actual service names or Docker Compose configuration identifiers as needed based on what you have defined above under FILE:config/serverSetup.js\ndocker compose up -d\n```\n\nRemember, this final deployment code is just a placeholder to remind about the step that follows development of all necessary files and tests within your timeline plan for Make.com Scenario Library project rollout on Railway by month's end as stated in day 30 objectives from the original implementation plan document provided above.\n\nThis is for opportunity: Make.com Scenario Library\nMake sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.",
