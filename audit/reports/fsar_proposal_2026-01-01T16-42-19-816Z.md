idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/20190814153706_create_revenue_table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS revenue (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    project_id INT REFERENCES projects(id),
    stripe_charge_id VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2) CHECK (amount > 0),
    currency CHAR(3),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    completed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    encrypted BOOLEAN ENCRYPTED COLUMN sensitive_data USING pgcrypto.digest(sensitive_text) STORED -- Assuming 'SensitiveData' is an optional column for private info
);

This is for opportunity: Rapid Business Duplication Consulting
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
