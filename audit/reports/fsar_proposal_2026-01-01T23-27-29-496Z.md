- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file models/index.js with this complete content:

const { Sequelize, DataTypes } = require('sequelize');

// Define User model with basic properties for this example
const User = sequelize.define("User", { /* columns definition */ }, {}); // Add necessary attributes and associations here based on the Users table schema from Neon PostgreSQL database migrations (which are yet to be created)
// ... additional models like Task, Income_Sources will go here...

This is for opportunity: LifeOS Automation Consultancy
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
