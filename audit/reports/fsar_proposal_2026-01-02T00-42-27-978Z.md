# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_9a787308-6e75-4025-8a63-51cc3b44397b
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T00:42:27.978Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file tests/api-v1/users.spec.js with this complete content:

const request = require('supertest'); // For making HTTP assertions against an app mounted as the root of the Node server (app) or express router being tested here, use your actual test setup for this platform...
describe('User API', () => { /* Your tests go here */ });

This is for opportunity: Personalized Learning Platforms
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
