idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.sql with this complete content:

// File: src/components/CustomerInfo.js
import React from 'react';
import { useDispatch } from 'redux'; // Assuming Redux state management (update as needed).
import './styles.css'; // CSS stylesheets, assuming they are in the same directory for simplicity and accessibility standards compliance.

function CustomerInfo({ customerId }) {
  const dispatch = useDispatch(); // Dependency injector from React-Redux if using Redux store management (update as needed).
  
  return (
    <div className="customerInfo">
      <h2>Customer Information</h2>
      <!-- Customer details rendering here based on customerId, assuming that the necessary data fetching logic is in place -->
    </div>
  );
}

This is for opportunity: AI-Powered Customer Support
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
