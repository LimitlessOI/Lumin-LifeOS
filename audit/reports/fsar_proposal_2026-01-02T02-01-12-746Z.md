# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_22b2b11d-ec3a-44dd-b63d-a805d49111da
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T02:01:12.746Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file project_structure/database/db-config.js with this complete content:

require('dotenv').config();
const NeonClient = require('neon'); // This is a placeholder for the actual PostgreSQL client library you might use, such as `pg` or `sequelize`. 
// Set up your database connection using environment variables from .env file. You'd typically have this in production setup with env vars like DB_HOST and other relevant details to ensure security best practices are followed (not shown here for brevity).
const client = new NeonClient(); // This is pseudo-code, the actual implementation would depend on how you choose your PostgreSQL client. 

async function createDatabaseAsync() {
    await client.connect();
    const res = await client.query('CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS chatbot_db');
    console.log(res); // Log success or handle failure accordingly
}

This is for opportunity: AI-Enhanced Customer Support Chatbots
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
