idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_4.js with this complete content:

*END OF FILE:charts/LightweightAssistantChart/values.yaml*

### Other Necessary Files ### [These are placeholders and would need to be filled in with the appropriate code or content.]
- `README.md`: Detailed description of this project, system architecture overview (referencing above plan), deployment instructions, monitoring setup guidelines including Prometheus configuration snippets for scraping metrics from our services if not handled by Helm/Kubernetes directly in a dashboard config file like the one outlined under Monitoring.
- `Dockerfile`: To build and run Docker containers encapsulating individual microservices components: (A simplified example, assuming Python as backend language)

This is for opportunity: AI-Powered Customer Support
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
