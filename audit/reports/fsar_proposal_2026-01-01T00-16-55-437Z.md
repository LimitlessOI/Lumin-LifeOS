idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api/payment.js with this complete content:

const stripe = require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY); // Ensure to add this key from your .env file or Stripe dashboard securely in the production environment only

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
