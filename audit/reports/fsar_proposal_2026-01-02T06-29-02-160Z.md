idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_6.js with this complete content:

module.exports = router;  # Export the routes for use within your ExpressJS application... API Endpoints: /pr (POST) - create a POST route that handles creating new Pull Requests, and `/reviews` (POST). -- Create similar APIs as needed to expose endpoints such as GET/GET_BY_IDENTIFIER(PRIMARY), DELETE endpoint for closing pull requests.

// Define Seed data using Faker Library or other seeding tools if necessary...  # Configure the `package.json` with express-generator and set up your own NodeJS server to handle these routes, ensuring that each action has proper validation (e.0..to=15; -- Additional endpoints for handling Pull Requests in different statuses as needed

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
