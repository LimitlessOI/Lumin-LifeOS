- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file views/index.js with this complete content:

import React from 'react';
// ... Complete component code using functional components and hooks if needed...
export default function Dashboard() {
    return (
        <div> // Your dashboard UI here </div>
    );
}

This is for opportunity: Business Process Optimization Consulting
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
