# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_922b866b-15dd-4204-9eba-bc3d2bd00280
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T18:44:11.976Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.js with this complete content:

import logging
try:
    # Code block...
except Exception as e:
    logging.error("An error occurred.", exc_info=e)  # Log the exception details here or elsewhere in your application logic with a proper logger instance configured at startup.

This is for opportunity: Overlay Game Distribution
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
