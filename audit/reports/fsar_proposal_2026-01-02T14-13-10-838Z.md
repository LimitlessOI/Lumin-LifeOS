- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/001_create_users_table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
  user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  profile_picture BYTEA, -- Assuming using PostgreSQL blob datatype for images or file paths as strings if needed instead of bytea
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  hashed_password TEXT NOT NULL
);

This is for opportunity: AI-Powered User Modeling
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
