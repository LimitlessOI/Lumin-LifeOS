- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_6.html with this complete content:

// TaskStatus Component - simplified example assuming props are passed from parent component/context provider in Railsway app infrastructure
function TaskStatus({ taskId }) {
    const [task, setTask] = useState('pending'); // Assuming a functional React state hook is used and this runs within the context of Lightweight Assistant.AI Council's framework (which may not be directly compatible with Railway without adaptation)
    
    return (
        <div>
            {/* Task status display logic */}
            <p>{task}</p>
        </div>
    );
}

This is for opportunity: Online Funnel Optimization Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
