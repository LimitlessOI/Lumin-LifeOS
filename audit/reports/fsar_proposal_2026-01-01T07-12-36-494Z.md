idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/2023_create_codes_table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS codes (
    code_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(100),
    description TEXT,
    language VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'plain', -- Python or JavaScript for example purposes
    content LONGTEXT,
    author_id INTEGER REFERENCES authors(author_id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT0TIMINGSENTITY_ID);

This is for opportunity: Subscription-Based Code Snippets Library
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
