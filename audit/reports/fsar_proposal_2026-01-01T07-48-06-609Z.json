  "proposal": "self_improvement:  To address the issues identified, we need to focus on several key areas to improve the system's performance and reliability:\n\n1. **Fixing the Database Schema**: The primary issue causing errors is due to a missing column in the `execution_tasks` table. This can be resolved by adding the `ai_model` column to this table via a migration script. Here’s how you can approach it:\n   - Create a new migration file that adds the `ai_model` column to the `execution_tasks` table.\n   - Update the database schema with this new column.\n   - This will ensure that future tasks have all necessary columns, preventing execution failures.\n\n2. **Optimizing Performance Bottlenecks**: The performance metrics indicate areas where optimization is needed:\n   - For long-running implementations (`implement_idea`), consider parallel processing or breaking down large tasks into smaller chunks to reduce latency and improve throughput.\n   - Implementing asynchronous task handling can significantly reduce the average duration for `idea_implementation` by allowing other tasks to proceed while waiting for less time-consuming operations.\n   - For short but repetitive improvements (`self_improvement`), consider automating these processes where possible to ensure consistent, quick execution without manual intervention.\n\n3. **Enhancing ROI Tracking and Visibility**: To improve the visibility of Return on Investment (ROI), integrate more detailed analytics with external financial data sources such as Stripe API for a deeper understanding of income streams. This integration would allow real-time tracking and analysis of revenue, expenses, and profitability across all services offered through LifeOS AI Council.\n   - Implement an automated routine that pulls daily or weekly financial snapshots from Stripe, compares them against predefined KPIs to detect anomalies or underperforming areas.\n   - Use these insights to dynamically adjust service offerings or marketing strategies for better ROI.\n\n4. **Ensuring Safety and Ethics**: With a focus on maintaining ethical standards in AI usage, consider implementing regular audits of the `ai_model` used in tasks to ensure compliance with regulations and internal policies. This can be automated by integrating regulatory databases or using machine learning models trained to detect inappropriate content or actions based on pre-set criteria.\n   - Set up a routine audit process that checks task outputs against established ethical guidelines, adjusting model parameters as necessary to meet safety standards.\n\n5. **Streamlining Monetization Flows**: To reduce friction in monetization flows, consider simplifying payment gateways and automating billing cycles for users. This includes implementing features like auto-renewal subscriptions or one-click checkout processes that are less cumbersome for customers.\n   - Implement user feedback loops to continually refine the purchasing experience based on customer preferences and behaviors.\n\nBy addressing these specific areas with targeted improvements, we can enhance system reliability, performance, and ethical standards while optimizing monetization efforts.",
