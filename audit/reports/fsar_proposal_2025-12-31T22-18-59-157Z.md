- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file database/models.js with this complete content:

const { Sequelize, DataTypes } = require('sequelize'); // Assuming sequelize is used as ORM tool for interacting with the database...
// Define models here based on SQL migrations previously provided and Neon PostgreSQL specific needs (JSONB support)...
module.exports = { User: Sequelize.define('User', /* attributes */), Order: Sequelize.define('Order', /* attributes including JSONB fields for recommendations if needed */) };

This is for opportunity: E-commerce AI Personalization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
