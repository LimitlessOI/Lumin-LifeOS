# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_658cd25e-8572-43c5-86b5-553bf5e365ee
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T09:14:52.469Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_5.js with this complete content:

module.exports = function(req, res, next) {
    if (!userAuthenticator(req)) return res.status(401).send('Unautbotic'); // Replace `UserService` and its methods accordingly for authentication purposes based on your design strategy (this is just a placeholder logic to illustrate the concept of protecting endpoints with middleware)
    next(); 
};

This is for opportunity: Self-programming System
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
