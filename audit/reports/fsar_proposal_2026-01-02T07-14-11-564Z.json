Monitor Kubernetes events and logs to ensure proper functioning (e.g., using Prometheus for monitoring).\n#### Step 7: Ensure that your Helm chart templates include these configurations securely without hardcoding credentials into files or secrets which can be exposed, always leverage best practices of secret management like KMS/SOPRs when deploying to production. Also ensure proper SSL encryption using cert-manager for Https (if needed).\n\nThis is for opportunity: QuickStart Automation Services\nMake sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.",
