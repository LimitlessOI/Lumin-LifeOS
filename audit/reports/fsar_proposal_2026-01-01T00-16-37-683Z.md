idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
// Assume necessary imports for database interaction are already in place
const { createTask, getTasksByStatus, completeTask } = require('../controllers/taskController');

router.post('/', createTask);
router.get('/status/:status', getTasksByStatus); // Assuming status is a query parameter that can be used to filter tasks by their completion state
router.post('/:taskId/complete', completeTask);

module.exports = router;

Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
