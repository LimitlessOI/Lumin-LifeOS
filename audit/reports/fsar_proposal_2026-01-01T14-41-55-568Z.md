- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.sql with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const dbConnection = {}; // Assume this is set up with Neon PostgreSQL database connection details elsewhere in your codebase.

router.get('/roi', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const roiData = await dbConnection.query('SELECT * FROM roi');
    res.json(roiData);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send('Server Error');
 01-api/v1/campaigns GET ENDPOINT:
router.get('/campaigns', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const campaignData = await dbConnection.query('SELECT * FROM campaigns WHERE end_date >= CURRENT_DATE'); // Ensuring recent data is returned for current analysis. Adjust as necessary for your business logic and requirements.
    res.json(campaignData);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send('Server Error');
  }
});

This is for opportunity: Real-Time ROI Tracking System
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
