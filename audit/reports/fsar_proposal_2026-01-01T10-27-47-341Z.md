# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_e29db221-22d7-434a-ac31-9932db8c5b70
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T10:27:47.341Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_6.js with this complete content:

import React from 'react';
// Import necessary dependencies and styles for Overlay Display Section 
class OverlayDisplaySection extends React.Component{   // Custom component to display overlays in the game interface using Redux or Context API (if needed) ...}
export default OverlayDisplaySection;

This is for opportunity: Game Overlay Distribution Platform
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
