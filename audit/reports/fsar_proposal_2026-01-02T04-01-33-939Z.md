- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file config/database.yml with this complete content:

default: &default
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  # The DATABASE_URL would dynamically load the connection string from an environment file or service like Neon's secrets manager, which is not covered in this example but should be implemented securely for production use.
  url: <%= ENV['DATABASE_URL'] %>

This is for opportunity: Business Process Optimization Consulting
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
