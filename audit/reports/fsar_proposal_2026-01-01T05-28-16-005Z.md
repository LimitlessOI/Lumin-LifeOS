- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_9.html with this complete content:

// components/makeComScenarioBuilder.js (React Component) // Assuming this is a single file component in the frontend setup using React with Babel transpilation through Make's infrastructure requirements for handling user-generated content safely, including appropriate CSRF tokens and data validation mechanisms before submission to backend services or integration points like Stripe.
import './makeComScenarioBuilder.css'; // CSS styling file tailored as per project design guidelines (not detailed here). 
const MakeComScenarioBuilder = () => {
    return <div> /* Scenario builder interface implementation goes here */ </div>; end;
};

This is for opportunity: Make.com Scenario Design
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
