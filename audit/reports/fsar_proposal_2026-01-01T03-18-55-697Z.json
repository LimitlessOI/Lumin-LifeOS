  "proposal": "self_improvement:  To address the issues identified, we need to focus on several key areas including improving database schema, optimizing task execution, enhancing error handling, and refining our performance metrics tracking. Here are some specific suggestions:\n\n### 1. Improving Database Schema\nThe primary issue seems to be related to a missing column in the `execution_tasks` table. This can lead to significant errors during task execution. Let's add the `ai_model` column to ensure that each task has an associated AI model identifier, which will help in tracking and managing tasks more effectively:\n\n```sql\nALTER TABLE execution_tasks ADD COLUMN ai_model VARCHAR(255);\n```\n\nThis migration should be conducted with caution, ensuring minimal downtime if possible. It's also advisable to run a data validation script before and after the migration to ensure that no data is lost or corrupted during this process.\n\n### 2. Enhancing Error Handling\nImplementing robust error handling mechanisms can help in reducing friction by preventing tasks from failing due to simple issues like missing columns. We should standardize our error messages and responses across all task executions, providing clear feedback on what went wrong and how it might be resolved for the user. Consider implementing retry mechanisms or at least guiding users through troubleshooting steps if possible.\n\n### 3. Improving ROI Visibility\nTo improve visibility into Return On Investment (ROI), we can integrate more detailed financial analytics with our Stripe integration. This will involve setting up webhooks to track specific events such as revenue, expenses, and customer interactions in real-time. Additionally, implementing a dashboard that visualizes key performance indicators like daily ROI, average revenue per user, and lifetime value would be beneficial.\n\n### 4. Enhancing Safety and Ethics\nGiven the critical nature of AI systems, maintaining high standards for safety and ethics is paramount. We can start by reviewing our AI models to ensure compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, local data protection laws) and implementing regular audits for ethical use. Additionally, enhancing transparency in how we handle user data will help maintain trust and adherence to privacy best practices.\n\n### 5. Reducing Friction in Monetization Flows\nTo improve monetization flows, consider simplifying the checkout process or offering more flexible payment options (e.g., subscription models). Implementing features like early access discounts for loyal users can also encourage recurring payments. Additionally, optimizing the user interface and experience through usability testing can help reduce drop-off rates during the purchase funnel.\n\n### 6. Enhancing Performance Metrics Tracking\nImplementing a more granular approach to tracking performance metrics will provide deeper insights into what is working and what isn't in our ROI model. This could include setting up custom KPIs for tasks, including turnaround time, success rate per AI model, and user satisfaction scores. Integrating these metrics with external analytics tools can also provide cross-platform perspectives on how to optimize the system as a whole.\n\n### 7. Self-Improvement in Code and Infrastructure\nGiven that performance issues are primarily related to self-improvement cycles, we should focus on optimizing our internal processes for updating models and handling tasks more efficiently. This could involve parallel processing of tasks, improved caching mechanisms, or upgrading the hardware infrastructure to handle larger data loads without significant delays.\n\nBy addressing these areas through a combination of technical improvements (such as database schema changes) and strategic process enhancements, we can significantly reduce friction in our monetization flows, enhance ROI visibility, and ensure that safety and ethics remain at the forefront of our operations.",
