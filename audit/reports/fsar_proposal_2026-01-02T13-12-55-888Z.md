- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.css with this complete content:

// File: routes/api.js
const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();

router.get('/products', async (req, res) => {
    // Logic to fetch and return all products from the database goes here
});

router.post('/products', async (req, res) => {
    // Validate request body using a schema validation library like Joi or express-validator
    const product = req.body;
    
    try {
        // Logic to create a new product in the database goes here
        res.status(201).send({ message: 'Product created successfully' });
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(400).send({ error: error.message });
    }
});

// Additional routes for orders, order_items and stripe charges would follow a similar pattern
router.get('/stripe-charges', async (req, res) => {
    // Logic to fetch Stripe charges if integrated goes here
});

This is for opportunity: E-commerce Conversion Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
