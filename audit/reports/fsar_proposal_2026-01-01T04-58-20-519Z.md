- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file auth/routes/index.js with this complete content:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();

router.post('/login', async (req, res) => {
    // Authentication logic here...
});

router.post('/register', async (req, res) => {
    // Registration logic here...
});

module.exports = router;
```

This is for opportunity: Make.com Automation Scenarios
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
