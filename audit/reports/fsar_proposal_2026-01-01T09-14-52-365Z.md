- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.css with this complete content:

const { Model } = require('sequelize');
class User extends Model {} // You need to set up Sequelize ORM here. 
User.init({
    name: DataTypes.STRING,
    email: { type: DataTypes.STRING, unique: true },
    password_hash: DataTypes.STRING(60)
}, {
    sequelize: dbInstance // This is the Sequelize instance connected to your Neon PostgreSQL database 
});
User.init({ id: { allowNull: false, primaryKey: true } });

This is for opportunity: Self-programming System
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
