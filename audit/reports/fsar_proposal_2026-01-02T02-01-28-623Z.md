idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/sales-funnel', async (req, res) => {
  // Implement API logic here
  const salesData = await getSalesFunnelData();
  return res.json(salesData);
});

function getSalesFunnelData() {
  // Function to retrieve and process the data from your database related to customer interactions within a multi-channel retail environment using AI techniques for optimization (e.g., machine learning model integration)
}
===END FILE===

This is for opportunity: AI-Powered Sales Funnel Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
