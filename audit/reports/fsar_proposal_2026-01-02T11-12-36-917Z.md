# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_cde239f3-54af-44ff-a9a5-7d3e5d09d784

- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file redisCacheSetup.js with this complete content:

const { createClient } = require('redis'); // Assuming you have installed redis-cli and NodeJS packages for interaction with the client, if not use npm install redis to add it first
const REDIS_CLIENT = createClient({ url: 'your_redis_url' }); // Replace your_redis_url with actual Redis server connection string. For local development this is often localhost and a non-default port (e.g., 6379).
REDIS_CLIENT.connect();
export default REDIS_CLIENT;

This is for opportunity: Game Overlay Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
