  "proposal": "self_improvement:  To address the issues raised, we need to focus on several key areas including database schema adjustments, task execution optimizations, and enhancing our error handling mechanisms. Here are some specific, actionable improvements that can be implemented:\n\n### 1. Database Schema Adjustment\nGiven the errors related to a missing `ai_model` column in the `execution_tasks` table, we need to update the database schema immediately. This involves adding the missing column and ensuring all existing data migrations are handled smoothly without data loss.\n\n**Actionable Improvement:**\n- Perform an offline backup of the current state of the database.\n- Update the schema by adding the `ai_model` column to the `execution_tasks` table using a migration script compatible with PostgreSQL.\n- Test thoroughly to ensure no existing functionality is affected and that new tasks can be added without errors.\n- Deploy the updated schema in an isolated environment before pushing it to production to avoid any disruptions.\n\n### 2. Optimizing Task Execution\nThe performance bottlenecks identified suggest areas where we can streamline our task processing:\n\n#### Implement Idea Type Bottleneck:\n- **Optimization Strategy:** Leverage asynchronous task execution patterns such as Celery or Kafka for handling tasks in a distributed environment, which could help reduce the average duration of both implementation and self-improvement types.\n- **Actionable Improvement:** Research and implement an advanced task queuing system that supports better load distribution across multiple servers, potentially utilizing Docker containers for scalability and resilience.\n\n#### Idea Implementation Type Bottleneck:\n- **Optimization Strategy:** Implement caching mechanisms to reduce the time taken by tasks that involve computationally heavy processes or data retrieval from external APIs. This could include using Redis for in-memory caching of frequently accessed data.\n- **Actionable Improvement:** Setup a Redis server and integrate it with your task processing pipeline. Implement cache invalidation strategies based on usage patterns to avoid stale data issues.\n\n### 3. Enhancing Error Handling and Safety Protocols\nTo maintain safety and ethics, especially in financial operations like ROI tracking and Stripe integration, we need robust error handling mechanisms:\n\n- **Improvement Strategy:** Implement multi-level error handling that notifies relevant stakeholders (developers, management) when errors occur in the task execution or data processing. This can be automated via email alerts or internal dashboard notifications using Python's `logging` module and integrating with an alerting service like Sentry for real-time exceptions tracking.\n- **Actionable Improvement:** Configure logging mechanisms to capture all critical system events, including operational errors and potential security incidents. Set up a robust monitoring system that integrates with external services (like AWS CloudWatch) for proactive issue detection and resolution.\n\n### 4. Reducing Friction in Monetization Flows\nTo improve the monetization flows and ROI visibility:\n- **Improvement Strategy:** Implement automated workflows for offer generation based on user behavior data, which can help tailor offers more effectively to individual users. This could include predictive modeling using machine learning algorithms trained on historical user interactions with offers.\n- **Actionable Improvement:** Develop a machine learning pipeline that predicts the effectiveness of different types of offers and adjusts them in real time based on feedback from users. Integrate this model with our backend systems for automated offer generation and testing.\n\nBy focusing on these improvements, we can enhance system reliability, improve operational efficiency, and maintain high standards of safety and ethics in all financial operations.",
