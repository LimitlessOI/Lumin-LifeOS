  "proposal": "idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api/offer.js with this complete content:\n\nconst express = require('express');\nconst router = new express.Router();\nconst { prisma } = require('../db'); -- As with user registration endpoint, ensuring correct alias and path adjustments to fit project structure (e.g., './models'). Adjust imports accordingly:\nrouter.post('/create', async (req, res) => {\n  try {\n    const offer = await prisma.offer.create({ data: req.body }); -- Similar approach for creating offers with proper Prisma client methods and request body structure as per model definitions which should include an `status` field to reflect the current state of the offered funnel step, adjusted based on actual application requirements such as user feedback mechanisms influencing offer status transitions:\n    res.json(offer); -- Responding with created offer instance and potentially including additional information relevant for UX/UI interactions within frontend components not shown herein due to focus scope limitation but should include necessary data structured appropriately (e.g., JSON objects representing nested offers if applicable):\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error creating new offer', error); -- Error handling for offering creation process, which may involve detailed feedback mechanisms based on actual Prisma client exception types or custom logic encapsulated within the application's UX/UI design considerations:\n    res.status(400).send(error.message || 'Offer creation failed'); -- Standardized response for registration process errors, adjusted to reflect specific needs based on actual database schema and business requirements not detailed herein due to scope limitation but should provide appropriate user feedback mechanisms within frontend components:\n  }\n});\n\nThis is for opportunity: Quick Start Online Income Funnels\nMake sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.",
