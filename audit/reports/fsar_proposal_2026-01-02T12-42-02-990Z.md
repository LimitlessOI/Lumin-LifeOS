- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/001_create_tasks_table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tasks (
    task_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    priority INTEGER CHECK (priority BETWEER 1 AND 5), -- Assuming a scale from low to high urgency/importance
    assigned_developer_id INT REFERENCES developers(developer_id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    estimated_completion DATE NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'in progress', 'completed'))
);

This is for opportunity: AI-Enhanced Product Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
