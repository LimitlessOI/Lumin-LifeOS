CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS revenue_tracking (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    task_id INT REFERENCES tasks(id),
    amount DECIMAL(10,2), -- Amount in local currency; consider using a standardized format for internationalization if necessary.
    stripe_refunded BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    transaction_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    status VARCHAR(50) CHECK (status IN ('completed', 'pending')) -- Ensure that this table also has appropriate foreign key references to content creators and tasks as required.

Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
