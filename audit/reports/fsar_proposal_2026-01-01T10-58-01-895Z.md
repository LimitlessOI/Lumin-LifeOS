- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_4.js with this complete content:

**NOTE: Always sanitize input data to prevent SQL injection or other forms of attacks, and ensure that your database credentials are stored securely using environment variables as demonstrated above for JWT secret key retrieval. Additionally, consider rate limiting on API endpoints like registration/login where possible to mitigate brute force attacks.**

### Refactored Code for User Login ###

This is for opportunity: Game Overlay Distribution Platform
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
