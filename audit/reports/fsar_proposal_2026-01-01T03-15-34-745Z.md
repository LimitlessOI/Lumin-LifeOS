- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file config/express.json with this complete content:

module.exports = {
    // Environment variable-based configurations would go here, e.g., for port and database connection strings; details will vary based on actual infrastructure settings provided by LifeOS AI Council team members earlier or established in project documentation (not shown). 
};

This is for opportunity: Digital Product Development Consulting
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
