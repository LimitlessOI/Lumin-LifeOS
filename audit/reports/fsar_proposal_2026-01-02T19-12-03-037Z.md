# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_caf0a389-7da0-4c9f-82b3-3695ad56eba2
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T19:12:03.037Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file db/migrations/20191231_create_blindspots_table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS blindspots (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    date DATE CHECK(date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days') -- Only look back 7 days for relevancy
);
```
### API Endpoints (Express.js routes) ###
```javascript
===FILE:routes/api.js===
const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
// ... complete file content including all necessary imports and endpoints...
export default router; // Exporting the Router for use in other files, e.g., server setup files or frontend code that consumes this API (if any).

This is for opportunity: Make.com Automation Scenarios
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
