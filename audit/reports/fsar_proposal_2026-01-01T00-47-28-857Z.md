- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.sql with this complete content:

-- File: migrations/001_create_processes_table.sql -- Start of file content ---
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS processes (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  description TEXT,
  industry_type VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITHO0UT TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITT1ND TIMEZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
-- End of file content ---===FILE:migrations/002_create_metrics_table.sql===### Express API Routes (`routes`) ###

This is for opportunity: Automation Optimization Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
