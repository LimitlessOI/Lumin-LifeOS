idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.js with this complete content:

// routes/api.js ===FILE===
const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
router.post('/content-generate', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const prompt = req.body; // Assuming input validation and sanitation are handled elsewhere or using a middleware like body-parser
    
    if(isLightTasksTrainedOnContentCreation()) {
      let generatedText;
      // Code to generate text immediately (Pretend function)
      const response = await GenerateImmediateTextAsync(prompt);
      
      res.status(200).json({ message: 'Generated content', data: response });
   03-15T14:45:00Z", "content": { "title": "AI and Ethics in Journalism" } },
  { "@type": "Event", "name": "Ethical AI Symposium", "startDate": "2023-09-10T08:00:00Z", "location": { "address": "Conference Hall, Journalism Campus" } },
  // Additional events...

This is for opportunity: AI-Enhanced Content Generation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
