# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_ca6ed139-4855-4479-9eeb-4a5da13e7e00
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T14:43:46.696Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_8.sql with this complete content:

**FILE:db/migrate/create_task_schema.rake** and **CREATE TABLES for Execution Queue Schema, ROI Tracking System etc... [Not feasible to generate full code here due to complexity]**  
*Note that all database schema files should be stored in the 'db' directory with proper naming convention based on Rails version as per Migrations best practices.* 

## Phase III - API Development (Days 21-45)

This is for opportunity: Online Business Enhancement Package
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
