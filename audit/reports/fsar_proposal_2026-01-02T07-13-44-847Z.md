- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file code/submit_queue.config with this complete content:

{
    "default": {
        "exchange": "", # no exchange needed for direct queue communication with the backend, as we'll use routing keys to target specific queues within our application contexts
        "queue": "submit-coding", # Name of RabbitMQ Queue created externally in Railway settings. 
    },
}

This is for opportunity: Custom Code Review Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
