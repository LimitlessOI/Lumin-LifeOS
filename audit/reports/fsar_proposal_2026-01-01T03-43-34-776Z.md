- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.sql with this complete content:

-- File: migrations/001_create_seo_analysis.sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS seo_analysis (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    website_url VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    seo_score INT CHECK (seo_score >= 0 AND seo09rkGnY6f/P14vU8xT7LbjK+DJXq3ZzCmRsMuNl1VpHcQBgwEA
    -- More database migrations as needed...
);

This is for opportunity: Instant Website Audit and Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
