- id: fsar_5aa604d1-23bb-4b74-99db-3e9fdc088742
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T12:15:57.493Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
const { getInsightAnalysis } = require('../controllers/systemInsightController'); // assuming a controller exists for analytics data retrieval
router.get('/api/v1/system_insights', getInsightAnalysis);
module.exports = router;

This is for opportunity: Online Funnel Optimization Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
