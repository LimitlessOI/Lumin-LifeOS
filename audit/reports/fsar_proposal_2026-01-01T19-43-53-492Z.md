- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.js with this complete content:

const { execSync } = require('child_process');
// Additional imports as necessary for your analysis engine setup 

async function performFinancialAnalysis(userId, startDate, endDate) {
    // Call external script or service that uses the AI to analyze financial data and returns predictions. Replace with actual call methodology used in implementation.
    const predictionOutput = execSync(`node ./path_to_analysis/analyzeFinances ${startDate} ${endDate}`);
    
    return JSON.parse(predictionOutput) as any; // Placeholder for the analysis results object structure 
}

This is for opportunity: AI-Powered Financial Analysis Tool
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
