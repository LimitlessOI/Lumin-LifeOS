- timestamp: 2026-01-01T19:43:30.792Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_4.js with this complete content:

import React from 'react';
import { Table, Space } from 'antd'; // Importing necessary components for dashboard page layout: /api/v1/system/self-program or a custom library setup if required by Railway's build system.
// ... rest of your server code and component logic...

This is for opportunity: Custom Software Development for SMBs
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
