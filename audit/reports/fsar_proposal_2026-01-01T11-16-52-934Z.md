- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.js with this complete content:

// routes/api_routes.js (Express router with API endpoints)
const express = require('express');
const apiRouter = express.Router();

/** POST method for creating user account using Stripe checkout */
apiRouter.post('/user', async function(req, res) {
  try {
    const token = await stripe.createToken({ email: req.body.email }); // Using the client-side library to obtain a secure and hidden Stripe payment method identifier (token). In production, this should be sent with HTTPS POST request body without exposing sensitive details like secret API keys on frontend
    const customer = await stripe.customers.create({ email: req.body.email }); // Creating the user in our system and linking it to Stripe for future payments (should ideally link this directly with actual payment methods after proper security measures are implemented) 
    
    res.status(201).json({ message: 'Account created', customerId: customer.id, stripeToken: token }); // Returning the newly created user and their Stripe Token for future transactions related to this account creation (this is a simplified example assuming one-time payment or subscription)
  } catch(error) {
    console.log('Error during User Registration');
    throw error;
  end file===

This is for opportunity: Overlay Game Development Kit
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
