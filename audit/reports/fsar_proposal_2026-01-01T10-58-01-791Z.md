- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.css with this complete content:

module.exports = {
  up: async (queryInterface, Promise) => {
    await queryInterface.sequelize.transaction(async transaction => {
      await queryInterface.createTable('Overlays', {
        id: 'uuid', // Using UUID for each overlay ID as primary key - ensure this matches your database schema requirements 
        title: Sequelize.STRING,
        description: Sequelize.TEXT,
        userId: Sequelize.INTEGER,
        price: Sequelize.FLOAT,
        createdAt: Sequelize.DATE // Assuming these fields are required as per your schema specification 
      }, { transaction });
    });
  },
  
  down: async (queryInterface) => Promise.resolve(), // No-op for rollback in this example - implement according to actual needs if deletion is needed!
};

This is for opportunity: Game Overlay Distribution Platform
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
