idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_5.js with this complete content:

To handle character encoding and decoding using custom logic tailored to TrueType fonts:

### File Font Encoder ###
This would typically involve writing a C++ function that can traverse the glyphs of each Unicode range you need, read their binary representations from memory (using pointers or other means), encode them according to your rules and store these encodings in strings within your application. Due to complexity, I'll outline only what this might look like:

This is for opportunity: AI-Driven Customer Insights Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
