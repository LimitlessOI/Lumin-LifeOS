- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_4.js with this complete content:

**Database Schema:**  
Neon PostgreSQL schema expansion including `projects` table with fields for project ID, name, description; linked tasks via foreign keys and an associated income tracking system without actual charge handling but focusing on logging revenue data tied back through reference IDs in Stripe's webhook delivery (maintaining 'blind-spot detection').

This is for opportunity: Custom Software Solutions
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
