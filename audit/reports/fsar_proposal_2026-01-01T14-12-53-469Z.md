- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.js with this complete content:

#### Integration Points ####: `config/database.js` (for PostgreSQL connection setup using Node's pg module or Python psycopg2 for Django ORM if necessary) ensuring secure SSL connections are established during API call sequences between frontend, backend APIs and Stripe dashboard scripts executed externally to respect 'monitoring'.

This is for opportunity: SaaS Product Duplication and Enhancement
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
