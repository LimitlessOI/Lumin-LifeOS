idea_implementation: Create or update the file db/migrate/20190730_create_transactions_table.sql with this complete content:

BEGIN TRANSA0;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS transactions (
    transaction_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT REFERENCES users(user_id),
    amount NUMERIC CHECK (amount >= 0) DEFAULT 0,
    status ENUM('completed', 'failed') DEFAULT 'pending'
);
COMMIT TRANSA0;

This is for opportunity: Stripe Integration Consulting
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
