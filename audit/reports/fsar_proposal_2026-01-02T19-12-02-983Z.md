- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file db/migrations/20191231_create_roi_snapshots_table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS roi_snapshots (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    task_id INTEGER REFERENCES tasks(id) ON DELETE CASCADE, -- Link to the specific task
    date TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    roi_data JSONB NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (task_id) REFERENCES tasks(id) ON DELETE SET NULL -- Handle orphaned data if task is deleted.
);

This is for opportunity: Make.com Automation Scenarios
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
