- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.js with this complete content:

### API Endpoints with Enhanced Complexity Handling:
1. **OAuth Authentication Service (`/api/v1/login`)** - Secure OAuth-based authentication endpoint where users authenticate, receiving JWT tokens to access other endpoints securely and manage login status in the system database (Neon PostgreSQL). It's designed for scalability with minimal resource usage.

This is for opportunity: Custom Automation Script Generation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
