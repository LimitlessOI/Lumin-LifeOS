# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_cf2922ba-8094-48b6-a324-5219643e325e
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T11:43:27.643Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_5.js with this complete content:

===FILE:config/dotenv===""
require('dotenv').config(); // Load environment variables from .env for any sensitive information needed, ensuring it's not hardcoded in the codebase - omitted here but critical as per instruction 10 and security practices generally.

This is for opportunity: Game Overlay Distribution Platform
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
