idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/2023_10_01_123456789_create_bizesystem_schema.sql with this complete content:

BEGIN;
CREATE TABLE Businesses (
    business_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    sector VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
CREATE TABLE Consultants (
    consultant_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    business_name VARCHAR(255),
    role TEXT,
    contact_info JSONB
);
CREATE TABLE DataAnalysts (
    analyst_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    consultant_id INT REFEREN01_local_bot:
 
### API Endpoints (Express.js routes) ###
```javascript
===FILE:routes/api.js===
const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();

router.get('/bizesystem', async function(req, res) {
    // Logic to fetch list of registered business clients from the database
});

router.post('/consultants/create/:business_name', async function(req, res) {
    // Logic for consultant registration and management with OAuth2 authentication
});

router.get('/data-analysts/:bizName', async function(req, res) {
    // Fetch data analyst assignments by company ID from the database
});

router.post('/tasks/create', async function(req, res) {
    // Create a new task with filters for priority and deadline settings
});

// Stripe API endpoints would require separate files as they interact with external services (Stripe's infrastructure). 
// However, here is an example endpoint to fetch revenue data filtered by company ID:
router.get('/incomes/:bizName', async function(req, res) {
    // Logic for retrieving real-world revenue from Stripe integration, with filtering based on business ID
});

// API endpoints related to BEE System project submission and status updates would also require logic implementation in their respective files. 

router.post('/business_process_optimization', async function(req, res) {
    // Logic for submitting a new consulting project detail with assignment management based on the given system's requirements
});

res.json({ message: 'This is where API response will be sent after processing.' });

This is for opportunity: Business Process Optimization Consulting
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
