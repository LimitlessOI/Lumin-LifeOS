# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_a1736d3e-f76d-4170-a07b-b2de5ada36e9
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T05:01:32.149Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file src/components/Dashboard.js with this complete content:

import React from 'react';
// ... other imports...
function Dashboard() {
    // Component logic and JSX here, e.g., map through tasks or teams assigned to a user etc. 
}
export default Dashboard;

This is for opportunity: Remote Team Management Software
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
