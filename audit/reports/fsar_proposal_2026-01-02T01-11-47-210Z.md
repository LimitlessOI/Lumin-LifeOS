# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_983db338-775b-4e96-b140-29ee23262084
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T01:11:47.210Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
// ... other necessary imports and configurations...
router.post('/overlays/new', light_tasks.queue, (req, res) => {
    // logic to create a new overlay item using the request data
});

This is for opportunity: Game Overlay Distribution
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
