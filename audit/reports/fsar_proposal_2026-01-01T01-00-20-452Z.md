- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file docker-compose.yaml with this complete content:

# Docker Compose to define services (chatbot service container), Neon PostgreSQL for the database and other necessary components like Redis if needed...
services:
 chatbot_service:
   build: ./path/to/chatbot/Dockerfile
   depends_on: [neon-database] 
 # Other services definitions go here including neon-database, stripe-microservice (if Stripe integration is used), etc...

This is for opportunity: AI-Powered Customer Support Chatbots
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
