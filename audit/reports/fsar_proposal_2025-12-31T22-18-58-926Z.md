idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/002_create_orders_table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS orders (
    OrderID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerID INT REFEREN0NC(users.UserID),
    ProductDetails VARCHAR(512),
    QuantityPurchased INT CHECK (QuantityPurchased >= 1),
    TotalPrice NUMERIC(19, 2) DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL, -- Assuming taxes and fees are included in this field initially.
    Timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    Status VARCHAR(50) CHECK (Status IN ('pending', 'completed'))
);

This is for opportunity: E-commerce AI Personalization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
