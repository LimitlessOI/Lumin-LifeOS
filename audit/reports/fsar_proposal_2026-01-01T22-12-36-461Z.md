idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/create_flights_table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS flights (
    flight_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INTEGER REFEREN0N CUSTOMERS(customer_id),
    payment_status TEXT CHECK(payment_status IN ('paid', 'pending')),
    pickup_location VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    dropoff_point GEOGRAPHYSPECARRAY[], -- Assuming PostGIS extension for geospatial data types. 
    estimated_time TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '5 minutes',
    actual_start_time TIMESTAMP WITHTIMEZONE,
    status VARCHAR(20) CHECK(status IN ('scheduled', 'in-flight', 'completed')), -- Add more states as needed. 
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIMEZONE ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
