idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_7.html with this complete content:

<!-- File: ./views/overlay-dashboard.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <!-- Required meta tags, title and links to CSS for styling omitted for brevity; include them as needed based on your project's design requirements -->
</head>0] => response ===FILER: Code snippets provided below contain placeholder functions representing the back-end logic which should be implemented according to specific business rules. The system details and functionality like user authentication, Stripe integration setup for payment processing, API calls via OAuth2 are assumed as part of this plan due to complexity constraints but not explicitly detailed in code examples here.

### 3 Files (Frontend) - `overlay-dashboard.html` & `app.js`:

This is for opportunity: Overlay Game Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
