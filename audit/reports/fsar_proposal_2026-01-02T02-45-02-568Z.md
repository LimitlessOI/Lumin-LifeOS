idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.css with this complete content:

// routes/api.js ===FILE BEGIN###
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const { validateEmail, createUser } = require('../controllers/userController'); // Assuming we have user creation logic in a separate controller file for modularity and reuse of code
const StripePaymentService = require('../services/stripePaymentService'); // Separating the payment-related service into its own module

// User Registration endpoint (POST) 
router.post('/users', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const userData = req.body;
        
        if (!validateEmail(userData.email)) { // Validate the email to prevent SQL injection and ensure data integrity
            return res.status(400).send({ error: 'Invalid email format' });
       s 21,593 -$875,611 + $13,137 = $-862,474 (net income)
- Net worth of partner owners at the start and end of year ($0): no change as there is only one owner with a 5% interest. The net value remains unchanged because all transactions were within capital contributions or withdrawals by themself which do not impact their initial investment directly in this context, but rather influence equity distribution for dividends later on.
- Total taxable income before the sale: $210,786 - $35,495 + $30,000 = $195,391 (net of expenses)
- Net worth difference due to partnership activities in 2022 is not directly calculated here as there are no transactions affecting the partner's individual net worth within this context. However, if we were considering personal taxes on a withdrawal and capital gains or losses from selling assets (which have occurred), those would be reflected accordingly after calculating gain/loss based on initial investment and sale price minus expenses related to asset sales.
- The company is projected not to pay any cash dividends this year, as the net income has been reinvested back into the business for growth purposes (reinvesting in new equipment or R&D). Hence no impact on partners' personal wealth from these transactions: $0. 

The initial investment by partner B was added to their capital account of only $13,254 and then withdracleness at the end yearly value which is not reflected here as it would be considered in subsequent years or when considering individual partners' contributions separately if needed for further analysis:
- Partner A’s investment + net income - expenses = initial capital (no additional personal contribution): $10,568.24 
+ Net Income after adjustments ($397,813) - Expenditure on equipment and R&D (-$21,593), minus the withdrawal from partner A's equity accounts: $-862,474 (represents a loss due to expenses not covered by net income).
- Partner B’s investment + initial capital - withdracleness = ending balance for this year only ($13,254): $0. 

Given the data and calculations above, here is an example of what financial statements might look like:

**Balance Sheet as at December 31, Year-End (in dollars)**

This is for opportunity: Custom API Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
