BEGIN; -- Commence the migration process to establish a robust database schema within Neon PostgreSQL for our subscription management system on Railway's live production stage (Day 31) as per plan details. This includes creating tables 'users', 'courses', and relevant models such as `subscriptions` and potentially others like transactions, with appropriate referential integrity to ensure robust end-to0
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users ( -- Initialize the primary user table for our LifeOS platform on Railway's production stage. This setup assumes a relational database design ensuring that each record represents an individual enrolled in subscriptions as required by plan details during API development phase and is designed to handle various roles within subscription management, including both admins who can modify course listings/content (if necessary for our live Rails version) and regular users with varying access rights.
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY -- Unique identifier that allows us to efficiently manage user records as required by plan details during API development phase on Railway's production stage (Day 31). This setup assumes a relational database design employing Django ORM-like relationships, ensuring referential integrity where necessary and appropriate for the platform requirements.
  username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL -- Representation of user name as per plan details with uniqueness constraints to ensure individual accountability in Rails backend during API development phase (Days 4-10). This setup assumes a direct correlation between usernames within our subscription management system, providing users an accessible and personalized identifier for course progression tracking.
  email VARCHAR(255) -- Email address as per plan details which will be used in user authentication during API development phase (Days 4-10). This setup assumes a unique constraint on emails to ensure that each registered account can receive updates or communication specifically designed for the LifeOS platform, facilitating secure and efficient subscription management operations.
  password_digest BINARY(64) DEFAULT gen_random_bytes(), -- Assuming bcrypt hashing as per plan details during API development phase (Days 3-10). This setup assumes robust security practices within Rails backend to safeguard user passwords, ensuring that we maintain integrity and confidentiality in subscriptions management. It's critical here not only for data protection but also aligning with best practice standards as outlined by Railway or Neon PostgreSQL specifications
  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP -- Timestamp of when the user was registered into our system, assuming automatic management through Rails onDays 4-10. This setup assumes that timestamps are crucial for subscription and progress tracking as required by plan details during API development phase to ensure seamless real-time learning experiences with AI curation considerations integrated within Railways' robust-magic infrastructure
); -- End of 'users' table creation script, ensuring referential integrity between users in subscriptions directly tied back from Rails backend on Railway stage (live), if necessary. This setup assumes a many-to-one relationship where one subscription could relate to multiple users or vice verssalbeit typically limited by business logic for our LifeOS platform as per plan details during API development phase
COMMIT; -- Finalizing the migration of 'users' table, setting foundations required before deploying on Railway live stage (Day 31) and ensuring that all migrations are successfully applied. This setup assumes a thorough testing process to verify schema integrity against existing systems as outlined by plan details for robust deployment within Rails backend

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
