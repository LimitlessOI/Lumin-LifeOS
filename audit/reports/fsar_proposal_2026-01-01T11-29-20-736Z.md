# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_52031355-acd6-424f-9240-ff8ee99ed958

- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.sql with this complete content:

-- File: migrations/create_orders_table.sql - SQL command to create an Orders table in Neon PostgreSQL with appropriate indexes for fast retrieval of user-specific order data 
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS orders (
    OrderId SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    UserId INT REFERENCES users(UserId) ON DELETE CASCADE -- Ensures referential integrity and allows foreign key constraints to be used. In a production environment ensure proper cascading rules based on the expected business logic in case of user deletions or updates that could affect order data (considerations for soft/hard delete scenarios, etc.).
);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_user ON orders(UserId); -- Composite index with UserId to speed up frequent queries regarding a specific user's transaction statuses. This assumes the Orders table has been created beforehand and is connected via foreign key constraint as shown above in create_orders_table.sql file (for performance reasons).

This is for opportunity: Stripe Integration Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
