- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.js with this complete content:

import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv(os.path.join(os.getcwd(), '.env'))
# Access variables as needed, e.g., API keys or database URIs if they exist in the .env file
API_SECRET = os.getenv('API_SECRET')  # Placeholder for actual secret key management approach using Railway's secure gateway layer with OAuth2 authentication method implementation on Railway platform infrastructure only (no external access allowed).

This is for opportunity: Make.com Scenario Creation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
