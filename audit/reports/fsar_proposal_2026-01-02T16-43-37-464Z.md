# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_2c74e548-19a7-4f16-b2e7-1cde64737096
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T16:43:37.464Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.js with this complete content:

// File: ./controllers/overlay-controller.js (within the relevant folder)
const overlayController = {
  createNewOverlay(req, res) { /*...*/ }, // Function to handle creating new overlays; see file for implementation details.
  
  getAllOverlays() {/*...*},
  removeOverlayById(id) {/*...*},
};

This is for opportunity: Overlay Game Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
