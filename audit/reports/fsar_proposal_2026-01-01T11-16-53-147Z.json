In production, use Stripe's CLI tool `stripe keys` command instead of hardcoding API secrets directly into the codebase. \nconst stripe = require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET); // Replace 'your-secret-key' with actual secret key obtained from Stripe CLI in real environment setup not within this example for security reasons: (This is a placeholder and should be replaced by the appropriate method of retrieving API keys)\n// ... Rest of stripe integration code using `stripe` object goes here, following best practices...\n\nThis is for opportunity: Overlay Game Development Kit\nMake sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.",
