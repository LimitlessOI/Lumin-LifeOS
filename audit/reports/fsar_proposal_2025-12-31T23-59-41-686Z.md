- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file db/migrations/20190831120000_create_products_table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS products (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    price NUMERIC(10, 2) NOT NULL
);

This is for opportunity: Stripe Integration Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
