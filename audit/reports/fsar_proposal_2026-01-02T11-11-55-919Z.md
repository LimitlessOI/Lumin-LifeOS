- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.sql with this complete content:

-- File: migrations/001_create_users_table.sql ===END FILE===
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    username TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    role ENUM('user', 'admin') DEFAULT 'user'
);

This is for opportunity: LifeOS Game Overlay Platform
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
