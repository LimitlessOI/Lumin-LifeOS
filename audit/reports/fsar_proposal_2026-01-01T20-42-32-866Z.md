# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_0caee6b1-888a-4391-b6ef-11c23d12bfb3
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T20:42:32.867Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/003_create_tasks_log_table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tasks_log (
    task_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

This is for opportunity: Virtual Assistant Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
