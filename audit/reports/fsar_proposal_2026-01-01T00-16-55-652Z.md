idea_implementation: Create or update the file test/transactions.spec.js with this complete content:

const request = require('supertest');
const app = require('../server').app; // Ensure to adapt this path for your actual server file 
// ... complete test suite content with necessary tests etc...

This is for opportunity: AI-Powered Financial Advisory
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
