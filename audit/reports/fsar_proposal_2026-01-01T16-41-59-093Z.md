idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.sql with this complete content:

---FILE:migrations/002_create_processes_table.sql---
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS processes (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    business_id INT REFERENCES businesses(id),
    process_name VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    start_time TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    end_time TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    status VARCHAR(50),
    created_by INT REFERENCES employees(id) NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);
---END FILE===

This is for opportunity: AI-Driven Business Process Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
