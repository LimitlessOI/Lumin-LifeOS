idea_implementation: Create or update the file /data/models.py with this complete content:

import tensorflow as tf
from transformers import TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
model = TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(path/to/saved_model)
# Define function to predict product preferences using BERT model with PyTorch (Placeholder):
def generate_product_recommendations(user_id, user_data):
  # Placeholder for the logic of generating recommendations based on AI analysis:
  pass

This is for opportunity: AI-Driven Market Analysis
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
