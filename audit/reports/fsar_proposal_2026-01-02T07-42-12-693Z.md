- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.sql with this complete content:

**API Endpoints Required Example using Express (React frontend would be separate, detailed as per its own setup)** 
For this example I'll provide only the backend part since React or Vue component generation is beyond scope:

*Code for handling code review submissions and status updates in `routes/api.js` - not a complete script but illustrative of structure needed to follow your plan.*

This is for opportunity: Code Review as a Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
