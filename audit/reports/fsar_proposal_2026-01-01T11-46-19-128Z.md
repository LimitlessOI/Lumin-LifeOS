# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_759ccfab-fa80-4bba-b9af-1b53e156c115
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T11:46:19.128Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file Docker/LifeOSAICouncil_Phi3MiniLocal/Dockerfile with this complete content:

FROM ruby:latest
# ... additional setup and configuration code required...
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs postgresql-client # example for installing dependencies in a Docker container.
CMD ["rails", "server"]

This is for opportunity: Code Generation Platform
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
