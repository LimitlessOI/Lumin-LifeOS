# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_615300f1-80c3-4788-b56e-082198e1f7a1
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T04:28:05.123Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/queue-api.js with this complete content:

```javascript
const kafka = require('kafkajs');
// Assume necessary imports are already done here, including express setup 

app.get('/queue', async (req, res) => {
    // Logic to retrieve tasks from Kafka and process them would be placed here
});
```

This is for opportunity: Tech Business Duplication
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
