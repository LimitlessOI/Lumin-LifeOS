- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file db/migrate/2023_create_templates_table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE templates (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
    design_id serial UNIQUE, -- Foreign Key from the designs table for relational integrity.
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    category VARCHAR(100),
    efficiency_score DECIMAL(5, 2),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, -- Automatically set when a new template is added.
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

This is for opportunity: Digital Product Templates
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
