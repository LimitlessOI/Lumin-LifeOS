- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_5.js with this complete content:

// services/paymentService.js
const fetch = require('node-fetch'); // Required for Stripe Webhooks if used.
module.exports.processStripeWebhook = async () => {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(`https://your_stripe_webhook_endpoint`);
        let stripeEvent;
        if (response.ok) {
            // Assuming Stripe events are JSON and we're using body-parser middleware to parse incoming payloads in our Express app: 
            const data = await response.json();
            if(data && ObjectId.isObject(data)) stripeEvent = data; 
        } else {
            return handleError('Stripe webhook call error', 500, 'Webhook request failed or returned an unexpected status code'); end; // HandleError function handles different statuses accordingly.
    };
};

This is for opportunity: Make.com Scenario Design
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
