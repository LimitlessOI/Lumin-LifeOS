- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_7.js with this complete content:

async function getRecommendations(userPreferences, sessionToken) {
    try {
        const response = await fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/completions', {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: { ...headers with necessary authentication tokens... }, // Replace this placeholder header variable accordingly  
            body: JSON.stringify({ prompt: `Based on a user who likes ${userPreferences}, suggest products`, max_tokens: 50 })
        });
        
        const recommendations = await response.json();
        return recommendations; // This will be used to generate personalized product suggestions for the UI  
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error fetching data from OpenAI API", error);
        throw new Error('Failed to retrieve product recommendations'); 
    }
}

This is for opportunity: Stripe + Online Funnel Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
