idea_implementation: Create or update the file deployment_config/rails.yml with this complete content:

```yaml
    production: &defaults
      environment: 'production'
      
      database: <%= ENV['NEON_DATABASE'] %> # Neon PostgreSQL DB settings...
      
      server: "railway"
      
      rails:
        hostname: "127.0.0.1"
        
    production+ssl: &production_ssl
      <<: *defaults
      environment: 'production' + ssl=true # Ensure SSL encryption...
    
    production_deployment: [&common, default] |> ProduceConfig do |cfg| 
      cfg.environment = :production+ssl if Rails.env == "production"
      
      rails {
        url: 'https://your-railway-application-domain' # Replace with actual domain...
        
        workers_number: <%= ENV['WORKERS_NUMBER'] %> 
      }  
    end

This is for opportunity: Webinar and Event Automation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
