idea_implementation: Create or update the file tests/api-resolver.test.js with this complete content:

const resolveTicket = require('../../src/controllers/ticketController');
// ... other necessary imports and setup here
describe('resolve ticket endpoint', () => {
    test('should mark the ticket as resolved successfully', async () => {
        // Test code to assert that a resolution is successful using mock data.
    });
});

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
