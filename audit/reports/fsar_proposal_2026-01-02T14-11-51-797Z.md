- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/2023_create_customer_data_table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS customer_data (
    user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    preferences JSONB DEFAULT '{}'
);

ALTER TABLE agent ADD COLUMN specialization TEXT;

ALTER TABLE tickets ADD COLUMN priority ENUM('Low', 'Medium', 'High') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Medium';

This is for opportunity: AI-Enhanced Customer Support System
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
