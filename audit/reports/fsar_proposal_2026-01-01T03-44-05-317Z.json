This maintains separation and manageability as per your plan's requirement to segregate functionalities like task queue management (`/api/v1/tasks`), offer designing (`/api/v1/offers`).\n- All services should implement similar RESTful principles, ensuring a seamless integration of microservices when the system is operational. \n\n===FILE:models/task_schema.sql===\n```sql\n-- Tasks table to store all tasks within Make.com with their respective details and statuses (assuming PostgreSQL):\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tasks (\n    task_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n    description TEXT NOT NULL,\n    priority INTEGER CHECK(priority BETWEEN 1 AND 5), -- Priority levels from low to high for queue management. Assume lower numbers are more urgent/important:\n    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending' REFERENCES make_com_offers (offer_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,\n    due_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL CHECK(due_date > NOW()), -- Ensures tasks are future-oriented and have a deadline. \n);\n\nThis is for opportunity: Make.com Scenario Design\nMake sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.",
