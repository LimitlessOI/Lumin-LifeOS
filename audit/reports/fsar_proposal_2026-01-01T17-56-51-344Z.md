- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file models/finances.js with this complete content:

const { Model } = require('sequelize');
module.exports = (sequelize) => {
  const FinanceRecord = sequelize.define("FinanceRecord", {
    id: {
      type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
      autoIncrement: true,
      primaryKey: true
    },
    taskId: DataTypes.STRING, // Assuming this is the foreign key to tasks table
    amount: DataTypes.DECIMAL(10, 2),
    transactionDate: {
      type: DataTypes.DATEONLY
    }
  });
  
  return FinanceRecord;
};

This is for opportunity: Automation Workflow Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
