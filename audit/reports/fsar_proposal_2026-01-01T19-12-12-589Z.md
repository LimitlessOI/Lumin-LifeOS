- id: fsar_d92ff8c0-9fb3-45d1-a5c1-d0e563f668fa
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T19:12:12.589Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file config/express-setup.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
require('dotenv').config(); // Ensures .env variables are loaded for environment configuration like port, database URI etc.
// Express setup code with middleware and other configurations...
module.exports = app;

This is for opportunity: Subscription-Based Learning Platform
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
