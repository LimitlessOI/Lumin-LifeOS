- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_8.js with this complete content:

### Step 4 - Frontend Components Development ###
#### Dashboard ####
`dashboard.js`: (React component displaying real-time invoice status with a list of pending payments)

This is for opportunity: Automated Invoice Processing
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
