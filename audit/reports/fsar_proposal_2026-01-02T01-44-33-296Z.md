- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.js with this complete content:

For the sake of this schema, we will assume that `name` includes a unique identifier like first name and last initial to avoid direct personal identification while still providing anonymity within our system's internal processes (e.g., progress tracking). The age field is constrained between 5-12 years old as per the requirements of this project, which align with schooling ages in most countries for language learning programs.

This is for opportunity: Automation Services Hub
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
