- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file stripe_integration/index.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
router.post('/create-payment', async (req, res) => { /* logic to handle creating payment intent and capturing revenue data without autopay */ });
// ... other endpoints for stripe integration...

This is for opportunity: E-commerce AI Personalization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
