- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/002_create_payments_table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS payments (
    payment_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT REFERENCES users(user_id),
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    currency VARCHAR(50),
    status ENUM('pending', 'completed', 'failed') DEFAULT 'pending',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

This is for opportunity: Stripe Integration Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
