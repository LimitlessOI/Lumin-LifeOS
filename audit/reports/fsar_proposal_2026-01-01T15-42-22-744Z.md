idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.sql with this complete content:

// config/k8s/deployment_yaml - Kubernetes Deployment YAML File using Helm Charts 
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: user-profiler-service
spec:
  replicas: 3 # Start with a small number of pods for development purposes, to be scaled up based on demand or as per the plan.
selector:
  matchLabels:
    app: user-profiler
template:
  metadata:
    labels:
      app: user-profiler
  spec:
    containers: # Define container(s) for your service here, e.g., Node.js or Python application running on top of Kubernetes environment with the necessary dependencies and configurations to execute API endpoints defined in routes/api.js file above using Express framework (or similar).
      - name: user-profiler-service
        image: mydockerhubuser/user-profiler:latest # This would be your application container, replace with actual Docker Hub or private registry repository where the app's Docker image is stored.

This is for opportunity: AI-driven User Modeling Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
