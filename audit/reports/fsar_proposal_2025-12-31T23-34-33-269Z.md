- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
// Import other necessary modules and services here (e.g., database connection, ai_model)
router.get('/customers', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const customers = await getCustomersFromDatabase(req); // Function to retrieve customer info from Neon PostgreSQL DB
    res.json(customers);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error retrieving custom users: ', error);
    res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
  }
});
// Other routes for POST /api/orders, GET /api/insights etc., will be added here with their respective logic to handle CRON jobs and Stripe integration via gRPC calls or REST API as needed.

Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
