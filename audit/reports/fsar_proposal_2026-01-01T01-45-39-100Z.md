- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.sql with this complete content:

// routes/api.js - Express.js API endpoints (simplified for demonstration)
const express = require('express');
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken'); // Assuming JWT-based auth is used throughout the application
const router = new express.Router();
const { createUser, getUserList } = require('../controllers/userControllers'); // Example controllers to be implemented elsewhere
const { createOffer, updateOffer, deleteOffer } = require('../controllers/offerControllers'); 
const { logInteraction } = require('../controllers/interactionsController'); // Interaction controller example
// ... other required modules and configurations for auth middleware would be here...

router.post('/api/v1/users', createUser);                   // CRUD: Create User (POST)
router.get('/api/v1/users', getUserList, verifyJwtToken);     // CRUD: Get Users (GET), assuming JWT verification middleware is used for security purposes
// ... other routes with their respective handlers and logic would be defined here... 

module.exports = router;

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
