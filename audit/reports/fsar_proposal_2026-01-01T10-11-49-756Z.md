Frontend dashboard component using React (for simplicity) with styling and Chart.js integration...

===FILE:components/Dashboard.js===
import React from 'react';
import { LineRangePicker, PickerGroup } from '@syncfusion/ejml-controls'; // Placeholder for chart components or similar library in use
import './Dashboard.css'; // Custom stylesheet file to be created with CSS styling rules as needed 

export default class Dashboard extends React.Component {
    state = {
        salesData: []
    };
    
    componentDidMount() {
        this.fetchSalesData();
    }
    
    fetchSalesData = async () => {
        const response = await axios.get('/api/v1/processed_sales_summary'); // Replace with actual API endpoint calling logic here 
        this.setState({ salesData: response.data });
    };
    
    render() {
        return (
            <div className="dashboard">
                <LineRangePicker dataSource={this.state.salesData} />
                // Additional Chart components and layout go here as needed for complete functionality 
            </div>
        );
    }

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
