- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.html with this complete content:

import React from 'react';
import './MakeComScenarios.css'; // Assume this is the CSS file for styles specific to Make.com Scenarios component layout/theme, not shown here due to format constraints but essential in practice setup)

function MakeComScenarios() {
    return (
        <div className="make-com-scenarios">
            {/* Imaginary rendering of scenarios based on Sequelize ORM querying */}
            {this.state.scenarios && this.state.scenarios.map(scenario => (
                <div key={scenario.id} className="scenario-item" onClick={() => this.handleInteraction(scenario)}>
                    <h3>{scenario.title}</h3>
                    {/* Additional UI elements for scenario details */} 
                </div>
            ))}
        </div>
    );
}

This is for opportunity: Make.com Scenario Generation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
