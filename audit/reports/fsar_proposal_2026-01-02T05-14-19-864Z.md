- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.sql with this complete content:

// routes/api.js - Assuming the use of Express for routing in an e-commerce platform duplication scenario:
const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
const productsController = require('../controllers/productsController'); // Hypothetical controller file path adjusted accordingly; ensure to create this if it doesn't exist yet

// CREATE PRODUCTS ENDPOINT (POST) - Handles the creation of a product in an e-commerce platform. Replace `yourSchema` with your actual database schema details for products table and fill out necessary fields as per requirements:
router.post('/create', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const newProduct = await yourSchema.products.insertOne(req.body); // Adjust according to the specifics of `yourSchema` API client library used for ORM like Sequelize or Mongoose:
    return res.status(201).json(newProduct);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating product', error);
    throw new Error('Failed to create a product'); // Replace with proper custom error handling in production code
  end of the file content===END FILE===

This is for opportunity: E-commerce Platform Duplication
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
