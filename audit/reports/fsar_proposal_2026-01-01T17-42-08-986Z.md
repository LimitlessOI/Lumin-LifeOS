# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_f3c82eeb-eceb-40fd-8f1d-b474f953edeb
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T17:42:08.986Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file config/stripe.js with this complete content:

```javascript
require('dotenv').config(); // Load environment variables from .env file for production security reasons
const stripe = require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY); // Initialize Stripe object with secret key set in the .env file, not hardcoded into any of your code files to avoid exposure risk
```

This is for opportunity: AI-Enhanced Stripe Integration Consulting
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
