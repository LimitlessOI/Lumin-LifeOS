idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_9.js with this complete content:

const msal = require('@azure/msal-browser'); // Use this package if working with Node environments; otherwise adjust as needed.
  const clientId = 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID';
  
async function authenticateUser() {
    const accounts = await signInMsalClient();
    
    if (accounts && Array.isArray(accounts)) {
        // User is signed in, proceed with data access:
        return true; 
    } else {
        alert('Authentication failed');
        return false;

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
