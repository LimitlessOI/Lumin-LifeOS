idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_5.js with this complete content:

### Step 2 - Configuring the Environment\footnote{\texttt{{`config/environments/production.rb'}}}}} Configure SSL settings using Rails defaults and environment variables for sensitive information in development, testing, production environments separately with `puma`. Include setting up OAuth strategies via OmniAuth configuration files to securely handle user authentication across different platforms without compromising on API performance under load from concurrent users.

This is for opportunity: Make.com Scenario Automation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
