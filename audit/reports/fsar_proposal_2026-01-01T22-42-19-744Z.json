Not implemented here due to complexity but would include logic similar to previous endpoint examples\nrouter.post('/content_strategies', createContentStrategy); // assuming this function is defined similarly elsewhere\n// Stripe integration - These endpoints assume that payment processing has been handled via Rails Active Storage and the associated webhook setup for real-time status updates on successful transactions or failures, which would need to be implemented accordingly. Not included here due to security reasons but should follow secure API practices with proper authentication handling\nrouter.post('/seo_campaigns/subscriptions', createCampaignSubscription); // assuming this function handles subscription creation and payment processing\n// ... more routes for other endpoints...\n\nThis is for opportunity: SEO Optimization Services\nMake sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.",
