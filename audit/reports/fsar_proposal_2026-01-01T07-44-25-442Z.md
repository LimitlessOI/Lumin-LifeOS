- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_6.js with this complete content:

def preprocess_data(spend_df):
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    labelencoder = LabelEncoder()
    
    # Assuming 'Department' and currency columns exist in the spend_df dataframe which we want to encode categorically for modeling purposes. Remove or adjust based on actual data structure:
    spend_df['Currency'] = labelencoder.fit_transform(spend end preprocessing...):

This is for opportunity: E-commerce Funnel Enhancement
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
