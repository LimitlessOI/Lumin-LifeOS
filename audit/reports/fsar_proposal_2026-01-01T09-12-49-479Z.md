idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
// API routes for campaigns, interactions etc...
router.get('/campaign', async (req, res) => {/* ... */});
// More endpoints as per the requirements... 
module.exports = router;

This is for opportunity: AI-Driven Marketing Services
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
