idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.sql with this complete content:

---FILE:migrations/2019_10_30_143837_create_projects_table.sql---
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS projects (
    project_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INTEGER REFERENCES customers(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    start_date DATE NOT NULL,
    end_date DATE,
    status VARCHAR(50) CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'in progress', 'completed'))
);

This is for opportunity: Business Automation Consulting
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
