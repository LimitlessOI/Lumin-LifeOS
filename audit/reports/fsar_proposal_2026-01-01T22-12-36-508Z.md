# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_3624d537-0acb-4e21-b3f4-68abc144ab9c
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T22:12:36.508Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const { validatePaymentDetails, captureRevenue } = require('./payment-logic'); // Assuming payment logic is encapsulated in this module for modularity and testing purposes. 
const router = express.Router();
// ... complete file content with API endpoints definitions using Express Router ...

This is for opportunity: AI-Driven Income Drones
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
