# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_7d36df0e-aba9-45ae-8448-46048bc494a3
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T09:13:53.669Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_4.js with this complete content:

const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

let userSchema = new Schema({
    // User schema with necessary fields like username, email, etc., and behavior data linked to the Neon AI Model Training Service 
});
module.exports = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

This is for opportunity: AI-Driven User Behavior Analysis
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
