# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_af33ead3-9582-4971-8054-651dbdcfaba7

- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file db/migrations/20190405_create_userdata.sql with this complete content:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS userdata (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    userid UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(), -- This is just a placeholder for the purpose of this example and should be replaced with your own unique identifier system 
    sessionlogs JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITHO0UT TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    deviceinfo VARCHAR(255), -- Replace with actual data relevant to the user's device (e.g., type or model)
    demographic identifiers JSONB - This could be anonymized and encrypted if needed for privacy 
);
```

This is for opportunity: AI-Driven User Modelling
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
