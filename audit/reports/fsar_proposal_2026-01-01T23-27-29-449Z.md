- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file app.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const cors = require('cors');
require('dotenv').config();

// Initialize Express app with CORS enabled and middleware for parsing request bodies
const app = express();
app.use(bodyParser.json()); // For parsing application/json
app.use(cors({ origin: '*' })); // Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), modify as necessary to only allow specific origins
// ... additional middleware and settings...

This is for opportunity: LifeOS Automation Consultancy
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
