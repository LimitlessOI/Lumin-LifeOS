- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.js with this complete content:

Create a new project and app using the following commands: `django-admin startproject inventory_management`, then navigate to your newly created directory with `./manage.py` command prompt, create an app within Django by executing this line of code for example `python manage.py startapp products`. Then follow these steps sequentially in order and remember not to skip any step:

- Define models ✅
To define the product model along with its fields like name, SKU, price etc., utilize Python's class inheritance by extending Django’s built-in `models.Model` as shown below within your app directory (`products/models.py`). Make sure to run migrations using `./manage.py makemigrations products` and then `./manage.py migrate`.

This is for opportunity: Make.com Scenario Design
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
