idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_6.css with this complete content:

import subprocess
import json

# Function to execute Java code and capture the output log for NullPointerException analysis 
def run_java_application():
    result = subprocess.run(['java', '-jar', 'MyApplication-cli-run/myapplication/target/MyApplication.jar'], stderr=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)
    
    if "NullPointerException" in str(result.stderr):  # This is a simplistic check and should be refined for production use cases
        error_details = {
            'timestamp': result.stderr.strip(),
            'log_level': 'ERROR',
            'error_message': "NullPointerException occurred",
            'file_path': '/opt/java/glassfish_home/glassfish/domains/domain1/logs/jobs.log'  # Assuming this is where the logs are stored
        }
        
        alert("NullPointerException detected:", error_details)
    
    return result.stdout + '\n' + (result.stderr or '')

# Function to send an alert notification, could be e-mail, SMS etc., depending on your infrastructure 
def alert(message, details):
    # Implementation of the actual alert sending mechanism goes here
    print(f"ALERT: {message}\nDetails:\n{json.dumps(details)}")
    
# Function to parse logs for NullPointerException occurrences and trigger debugging actions or notifications 
def monitor_logs():
    with open('/opt/java/glassfish_home/glassfish/domains/domain1/logs/jobs.log', 'r') as log_file:
        # Implementation of the real-time monitoring system goes here, could be a loop or scheduled task for continuous checking 
        
# Start by running your Java application and capturing output logs that might contain NullPointerException issues

Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
