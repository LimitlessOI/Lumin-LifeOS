- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_7.js with this complete content:

from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String, DateTime
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import scoped_session, sessionmaker
import asyncio

Base = declarative_base()  # Define your ORM models here (omitted for brevity).
engine = create end(get_db_url())  # Placeholder function to get database connection URL string from environment variables or a config file.
SessionFactory = sessionmaker(bind=create_engine(engine))
session = scoped_session(SessionFactory)()

async def apply_discounts():
    async with RedisCache(), AsyncHTTPClient() as http:  # Using an asynchronous HTTP client for handling requests (omitted due to length constraints).
        try:
            order_data = await request.get_json()
            
            customer_tier = get_customer_tier(order_data['user']['id'])
            currency, rate = await fetch_exchange_rate(order_data['currency'])  # Handle leap years and time-sensitive discount codes here (omitted due to length constraints).
            
            if customer_tier == 'VIP':
                apply_discounts.apply(order_data, rate)
                
        except Exception as e:
            log.error('Exception encountered', exc_info=True)  # Log errors appropriately for review (omitted due to brevity).

This is for opportunity: Stripe Integration and Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
