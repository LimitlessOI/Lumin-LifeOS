- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file server/index.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
require('dotenv').config();
const apiRoutes = require('./api/routes');
// ... more required modules...

const app = express();
app.use(express.json()); // for parsing application/json

// Apply environment variables from .env file or similar configuration files here, e.g.,:
require('dotenv').config({ path: './.env' }); 

// ... additional middleware if needed...

apiRoutes(app);

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3001;

app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console002_console.info(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});

This is for opportunity: Remote Team Management Software
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
