  "proposal": "self_improvement:  To address the issues highlighted, we should focus on several key areas to improve the system's performance and stability while maintaining ethical standards in our operations. Here are specific, actionable improvements:\n\n### 1. **Immediate Code Fixes**\n- **Database Schema Update:** Since the error indicates that the `ai_model` column does not exist in the `execution_tasks` table, we need to update the schema of this table to include it. This can be done via a database migration script.\n  ```sql\n  ALTER TABLE execution_tasks ADD COLUMN ai_model VARCHAR(255);\n  ```\n- **Code Review and Testing:** Perform a thorough review of all tasks that involve `ai_model` to ensure proper handling and validation across the codebase. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and system testing to catch any potential issues early.\n\n### 2. **Performance Optimization**\n- **Query Optimization:** Analyze slow queries causing high average durations. Use database profiling tools to identify bottlenecks in SQL queries related to tasks, especially those involving `ai_model`. Optimize these queries for better performance.\n- **Caching Strategies:** Implement caching mechanisms where appropriate, particularly for data that doesn't change frequently but is accessed frequently (e.g., configurations related to AI models). Use tools like Redis or in-memory caching solutions depending on the application architecture.\n\n### 3. **Monetization Flows**\n- **Enhanced ROI Tracking:** Implement more detailed and real-time tracking for Return On Investment (ROI) by integrating with Stripe APIs to track revenue streams accurately. This includes setting up webhooks from Stripe to update our internal ROI metrics in near real-time.\n- **User Feedback Integration:** Collect user feedback directly through the app or via email/feedback forms to understand pain points and areas for improvement more effectively, which can help refine monetization strategies without relying solely on automated systems.\n\n### 4. **Blind Spot Detection**\n- **Enhanced Monitoring:** Set up additional monitoring tools that are specifically designed to detect blind spots in various processes. This includes setting up alerts for unusual spikes or drops in tasks completion times and using anomaly detection algorithms based on historical data.\n- **User Behavior Analysis:** Use AI to analyze user behavior patterns, especially those related to monetization interactions (e.g., purchases, task completions), to identify potential blind spots where users might not be engaging optimally.\n\n### 5. **Safety and Ethics**\n- **Data Privacy Compliance:** Ensure that all personal data handled by the system complies with local data protection regulations (like GDPR, if applicable). Implement strong encryption and anonymization techniques for sensitive information.\n- **AI Model Governance:** Establish a governance framework for AI models to ensure they are used ethically and within predefined safety boundaries. This includes regular audits and setting up feedback loops from users or ethical advisors.\n\n### Implementation Steps:\n1. **Update the database schema in Neon PostgreSQL.**\n2. **Create a migration script to add `ai_model` to the `execution_tasks` table.**\n3. **Implement caching mechanisms where applicable.**\n4. **Set up and test ROI tracking with Stripe webhooks.**\n5. **Deploy additional monitoring tools for performance and blind spot detection.**\n6. **Review and update user feedback collection methods.**\n7. **Update the AI model governance framework to include regular audits and feedback loops.**\n\nBy implementing these improvements, we can reduce errors, optimize performance, enhance ROI visibility, and maintain a robust ethical framework in our operations.",
