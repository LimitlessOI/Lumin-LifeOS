idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_4.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS snapshots_and_blindspots (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    gamedb_id INT REFERENCES games(id),
    timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    player_metrics_count INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (player_metrics_count > 0) -- Number of active players at this snapshot. e.g., if there are currently five players online in the game instance with id=123456789: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM player_metrics WHERE gamedb_id = 123456789;
    blindspot_count INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (blindspot_count <= player_metrics_count) -- Number of detected blurred vision or screen issues at this snapshot. e.g., if there are currently two instances where players reported a glitch in the game environment: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM detection WHERE gamedb_id = 123456789 AND type = 'blindspot';
);

Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
