idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_9.js with this complete content:

// Documentation files like docs/README.md goes here -- to be auto-generated using `touch README.md` command if not already present with standard content reflecting necessary instructions and guidelines for system usage etc., alongwith installation guide, business rules explanation as per project structure requirements or design details provided above (optional).

This is for opportunity: Stripe Integration Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
