- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.css with this complete content:

// File: config/database.js
module.exports = {
    client: 'postgresql', // Or Neon ORM specific settings if using PostgreSQL with Neon for additional features like UUID generation, etc.
};

This is for opportunity: Digital Product Launch Kit
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
