- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_5.sql with this complete content:

const resolvers = {
  Subscription: {
    onGameProgress: async ({ cache, getCacheKey }) => {
      const sessionId = 'unique-session-id'; // This should be dynamically generated based on the current user and game context.
      
      if (!cache.has(getCacheKey())) return;  // If this is not a new or existing subscription we can ignore it for now to avoid unnecessary processing/network calls, assuming that Apollo Server client initializes subscriptions with `Subscription` fragment provided above when the user interacts within our AI Council app prompting them to enter gaming session details.
      
      // Logic here would handle updating and sending progress data back downstream whenever there is a change in game state or achievement status for given `{userId}` associated with the specified `sessionId`. This can be tied into Django/Express GraphQL APIs as per your initial plan, ensuring that any updates related to user's revenue snapsh0t through Stripe (if enabled) are also logged here.
      
      return { id: 'unique-subscription-id', dataPath: ['userGames'] }; // Assuming `dataPath` is a field for resolving subscription with the required nested objects or arrays of game progresses, similar to how Apollo Client subscribes and receives updates over time within React Native environment using Expo Framework.
    }
  }
};

This is for opportunity: LifeOS Overlay Game Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
