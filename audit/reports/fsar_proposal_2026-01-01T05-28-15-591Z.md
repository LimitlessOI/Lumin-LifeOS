- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.js with this complete content:

// routes/api.js (Express.js)
const express = require('express');
const { createOrder } = require('../controllers/orderController'); // Assuming order creation logic is in this file
const router = express.Router();

router.post('/orders', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const result = await createOrder(req.body);
        if (!result.error && req.user) {
            return res.status(201).send({ message: 'Order created successfully.' });
        } else {
            return handleError('unable to process the request', 400, result ? [{ error: `Failed to create order - ${result}` }] : undefined);
        end; // HandleError function handles different statuses accordingly.
    };
});

This is for opportunity: Make.com Scenario Design
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
