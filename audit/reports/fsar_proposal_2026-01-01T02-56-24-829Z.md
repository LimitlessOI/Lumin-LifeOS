idea_implementation: Create or update the file config/databaseConfig.js with this complete content:

module.exports = {
    // Neon PostgreSQL Database Connection String for Railway environment (placeholder) -- OWNERTO: This string needs to be replaced by the actual connection details once established between LifeOS and Railway's database, which are not provided here due to missing specific details but assumed as part of a complete system.
};

Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
