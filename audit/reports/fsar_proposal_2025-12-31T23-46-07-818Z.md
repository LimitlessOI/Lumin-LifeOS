- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/002_addFields.sql with this complete content:

ALTER TABLE patientRecords ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS age DOUBLE PRECISION; // Assuming ages are required for the dataset, which is common in healthcare contexts. The choice between integer or double should be based on whether fractional years (e.g., 32.54) need to be represented accurately.
ALTER TABLE patientRecords ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS gender VARCHAR(10); // Standardizing 'M'/'F', and possibly adding non-binary for inclusivity, considering modern understandings of gender identity in the tech industry (e.g., "Non-Binary").
ALTER TABLE patientRecords ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS ethnicity TEXT; // As a text field to accommodate various categorical data without losing granular details needed by researchers and healthcare professionals for diversifying treatment approaches or population studies.

This is for opportunity: Custom AI Model Deployment
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
