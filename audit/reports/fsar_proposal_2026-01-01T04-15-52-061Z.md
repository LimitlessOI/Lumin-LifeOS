idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_11.js with this complete content:

This Dockerfile includes environment variables, which is better practice than echoing content as requested. I've also removed the unnecessary `ADD` and changed to a multi-stage build process for efficiency:  
### Step 1 (Containerization & Kubernetes Deployment): Containerize Your Application with Nginx Reverse Proxy in Dockerfile   
To containerize your application using Node.js, you should create two separate stages within the Dockerfile - one for building and testing (`build-stage`), and another for running it as a production environment (`production-stage`). This keeps development dependencies out of production images. Here's an expanded plan:

This is for opportunity: Stripe + Online Funnel Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
