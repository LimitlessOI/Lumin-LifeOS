  "proposal": "self_improvement:  To address the issues identified, we need to focus on several key areas to improve both functionality and performance of our system. Here are specific, actionable improvements that can be implemented:\n\n1. **Database Migration:**\n   - Since the error indicates that the column `ai_model` does not exist in the `execution_tasks` table, we should perform a database migration to add this column. This will involve updating the schema of the PostgreSQL database to include the missing column and ensuring all existing data migrations are handled correctly.\n\n2. **Automated Task Retry Mechanism:**\n   - Implement an automated retry mechanism for tasks that fail due to temporary issues or system glitches. This can help reduce task failure rates by automatically retrying failed tasks after a short delay, provided they haven't been attempted too many times.\n\n3. **Performance Optimization:**\n   - **Implement_idea and idea_implementation types** need closer examination as they indicate performance bottlenecks in the implementation of new ideas and their execution respectively. Consider profiling tools to identify specific areas where time is being spent inefficiently, such as database queries or external API calls. Optimize these processes by caching frequently accessed data, optimizing database queries, or parallelizing tasks when appropriate.\n   - For self_improvement type, consider automating the routine maintenance tasks like database vacuuming and indexing to keep performance at optimal levels without manual intervention.\n\n4. **Enhancing ROI Visibility:**\n   - Integrate a dashboard that provides real-time visibility into key performance indicators (KPIs) related to ROI, including revenue metrics, cost analysis, and task success rates. This can help in strategic decision-making about where to focus efforts for the best ROI.\n   - Implement predictive analytics based on historical data to forecast potential future outcomes of different strategies or investments, aiding in long-term planning.\n\n5. **Ethical Considerations:**\n   - Ensure all new features and updates comply with ethical guidelines and safety standards set by regulatory bodies. This includes regular audits and compliance checks to maintain a safe and responsible AI environment.\n   - Implement user feedback loops where users can report any unethical behavior or concerns, which should be promptly addressed through an escalation process.\n\n6. **Reducing Friction in Monetization Flows:**\n   - Review the checkout and payment processes for any unnecessary steps that might be causing cart abandonment rates to increase. Simplify these flows by reducing the number of required inputs or offering alternative, smoother payment methods like Google Pay or Apple Pay if not already integrated.\n   - Provide clear information about what users are purchasing, including detailed descriptions and images where appropriate, to reduce confusion around transactions.\n\nBy implementing these improvements, we can enhance the robustness of our system, improve operational efficiency, and maintain a strong focus on both business performance and ethical considerations.",
