- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/001_create_duplication_templates_table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS duplication_templates (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    success_rate DOUBLE PRECISION CHECK (success_rate >= 0 AND success_rate <= 1),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

This is for opportunity: Tech Business Duplication
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
