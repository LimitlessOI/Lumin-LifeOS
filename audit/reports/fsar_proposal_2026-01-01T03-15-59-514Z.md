- id: fsar_e8299195-945d-4a50-8bb2-be7e13e3fc36
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T03:15:59.514Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file middlewares/helmet.js with this complete content:

const helmet = require('helmet'); // Assuming necessary imports are done above this code snippet here...
app.use(helmet());  // Security headers added globally to the Express application, including CSRF protection and content security policies among others as per robust-magic documentation recommendations for best practices in production environments...

This is for opportunity: Online Course for Automation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
