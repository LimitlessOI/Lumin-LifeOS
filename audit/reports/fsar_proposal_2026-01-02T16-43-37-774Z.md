- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_9.js with this complete content:

#### Player feedback - `api/v1/player-feedback` & respective controller (`controllers/user-feedback_controller.js`) and integration with player surveys or prompts within the game development platform's UI:

This is for opportunity: Overlay Game Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
