# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_137ab0f7-4367-4d1a-a037-80d9f5680be3
- timestamp: 2025-12-31T22:18:59.209Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file database/index.js with this complete content:

const sequelize = require('sequelize'); // Assume this is the connection established to Neon PostgreSQL...
require('./models').User;
require('./models').Order;
// ... any additional setup for database connectivity, migrations or seeding if necessary...
```

#### API Endpoints ####

These will interact with self-programming system and handle the rest of your functionalities like personalized recommendations. The actual logic within these endpoints should integrate data from Neon PostgreSQL to perform actions as per requirements stated in the implementation plan above, but for brevity here we'll focus on just setting up endpoint stubs:

```javascript
===FILE:routes/api_v1.js===
const express = require('express');
const { router } = require('../execution_queue'); // Include execution queue routes...
const selfProgramRouter = require('./self-program'); // Self-programming system endpoints...
// ... include other necessary imports and route definitions here, such as recommendation logic that involves calling the personalization service based on user data from Neon PostgreSQL.

This is for opportunity: E-commerce AI Personalization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
