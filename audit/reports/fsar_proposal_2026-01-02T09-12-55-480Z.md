idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.css with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
// Define the required routes for queueing, analyzing tasks and revenue capture with optional Stripe integration... 
router.post('/tasks', async (req, res) => {
    // Code to enqueue AI analysis tasks goes here ...
});

router.get('/analyze/:business_process_type', async (req, res) => {
    const businessProcessType = req.params.business_process_type;
    try {
        // Fetch and return data for the specified AI analysis based on current metrics...
        res.json({ message: 'Analysis complete' });
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).send('Error in processing request');

This is for opportunity: AI-based Business Process Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
