- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_7.sql with this complete content:

5. Stripe Integration setup instructions or scripts can be documented separately as they involve a mix of scripting to handle API interactions with the external service and database updates that are not detailed here due to complexity/lack of specifics in user prompt 
6. CI/CD pipeline configuration - `jenkinsfile` (Jenkins Pipeline Example):

This is for opportunity: Make.com Scenario Generation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
