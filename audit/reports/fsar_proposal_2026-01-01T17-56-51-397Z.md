- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file config/stripe-keys.env with this complete content:

STRIPE_API_KEY=your_live_api_key_here
REVENUE_ACCOUNT_ID=your_revenue_account_id_from_Stripe
SECRET_KEY='secret_for_payment' // Should be kept secret and not hardcoded in production environment.

This is for opportunity: Automation Workflow Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
