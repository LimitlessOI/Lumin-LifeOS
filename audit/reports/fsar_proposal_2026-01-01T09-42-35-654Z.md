- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.js with this complete content:

// routes/api.js ===START FILE===
const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
const { checkUserAccess, createProject } = require('../../controllers/projectController'); // Example imports from controllers directory based on the schema provided in Plan 2 and assumed structure of other files within LifeOS AI Council infrastructure

// Route to handle user account management (pseudo-code) - assumes existence of authentication middleware elsewhere which is not detailed here.
router.post('/login', authenticateUser, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const token = generateAuthenticationToken(req.user); // Pseudo code for generating a JWT or similar auth token based on user credentials provided in the request body. Not implemented here as per instruction details.
    req.session.token = token;
    
    res.status(200).send({ message: 'User logged in successfully', access_token: token }); // Returns an authentication jwt or similar to authenticated user (not a real working example)
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(401).send({ error: 'Unaut0 - "user could not be authenticated"'});
  }
});

router.get('/logout', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    req.session.token = null; // Logic to handle user log out and token removal from session would go here if using a JWT-based auth system for example. Not implemented as per instruction details.
    
    deleteUserFromSession(req); // Pseudo code - assumes existence of function that handles the deletion process in sessions (not detailed). 
    
    res.status(204).send(); // No content, just a status response indicating success. Not an actual working example but demonstrates expected functionality based on Plan details provided.
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send({ error: 'Internal Server Error - User logout process failed'});
  }
});

router.post('/create-project', checkUserAccess, createProject); // Pseudo code route for creating a new project which uses the CRUD operations and user roles/permissions defined in Plan details provided above (not an actual working example). Assumed to be implemented elsewhere within controllers directory based on LifeOS AI Council infrastructure.

This is for opportunity: AI-Assisted UX/UI Design Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
