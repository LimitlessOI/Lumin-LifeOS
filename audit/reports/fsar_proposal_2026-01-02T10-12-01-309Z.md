- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();

router.post('/inventory_update', asyncHandler(async function updateInventory(req, res) {
  // Logic to handle inventory updates goes here...
}));

router.post('/order_capture', asyncHandler(async function captureOrder(req, res) {
  try {
    const order = await Order.create(req.body);
    if (StripeIntegrationEnabled && !stripeWebhookHandled(order)) {
      handleStripePaymentSubmission(order).then(() => {
        return res.status(201).json(order); // Success response with order object including Stripe details upon successful capture or dispute resolution handling logic if required. 
      }).catch((error) => {
        consoles('Error processing payment:', error);
        return res.status(400).send({ message: 'Payment submission failed' }); // Error response in case of issue with Stripe integration (if used), else use appropriate status for general success or errors as per application logic and design decisions made by Railway AI Council on the EcoBoost System Plan.
      }).finally(() => {
        clearStripeQueueItem(order); // Optional: Clear this order from Stripe's queue to prevent duplication if necessary, based on project specifications regarding payment processing and queuing mechanisms within Railway AI Council implementation plan parameters for the E-Commerce Boost Services Implementation Plan.
      });
    } else {
      return res.status(201).json(order); // Success response with order object if Stripe integration is not used or payment has been processed by another means, as per project design decisions and Railways AI Council's implementation plan specifications for EcoBoost System Plan on the LifeOS ecosystem.
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err); // Error logging to application logs with ActiveRecord callback error handling or alternative monitoring setup as per project requirements and specified by Railway AI Council in implementation plan specifications, using Lightweight Assistant's analysis functions for immediate recommendations if needed based on simple_analysis specialty of Phi-3 Mini (Local).
    return res.status(500).send({ message: 'Internal Server Error' }); // General server error response as per project design decisions and Railway AI Council’s implementation plan specifications for the EcoBoost System Plan on LifeOS Railways ecosystem, with appropriate logging setup if specified in Lightweight Assistant (Phi-3 Mini) capabilities within execution queue.
  } finally {
    res.clearCookie('stripe_session'); // Optional: Clear Stripe session cookie to prevent fraudulent activities or rejections as per project design decisions and Railway AI Council's implementation plan specifications for the EcoBoost System Plan on LifeOS Railways ecosystem, utilizing Phi-3 Mini (Local)'s monitoring capabilities if needed based on simple_analysis specialty.
  }
});

This is for opportunity: E-commerce Boost Services
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
