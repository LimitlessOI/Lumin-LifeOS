# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_d27abd71-62be-4d4e-a04a-9f1c2ac36a6d
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T20:57:33.199Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file controllers/projectController.js with this complete content:

const projectModel = require('../models/Project'); // Assume this model is already defined and handles interactions with the projects table in Neon PostgreSQL
module.exports.createProject = async function(req, res) { /* Implement create logic */ };
/* ... Other controller methods for CRUD operations on Projects... */

This is for opportunity: Quick-Deploy Web Apps
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
