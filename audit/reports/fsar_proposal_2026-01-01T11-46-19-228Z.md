# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_5b03a427-5462-4c67-969a-f42f438b8374
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T11:46:19.228Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file controllers/payments_controller.rb with this complete content:

class PaymentsController < ApplicationController
  # Define controller actions that handle potential payments with stripe integration...
end

This is for opportunity: Code Generation Platform
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
