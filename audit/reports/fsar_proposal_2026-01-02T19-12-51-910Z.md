- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file /routes/api.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
require('dotenv').config();
const { User, Subscription } = require('../models'); // Sequelize ORM models for PostgreSQL
const router = express.Router();

// POST /users - Register and authenticate users with JWT (pseudo code)
router.post('/', async (req, res) => {
    const user = await User.create(req.body); // Create a new user using the ORM model `User` which is generated from Sequelize models file (`models/index.js`)
    return res.status(201).json(user);
});

// POST /subscriptions - Handle subscription creation and management (pseudo code)
router.post('/', async (req, res) => {
    const planType = req.body.plan_type; // Assuming the request body contains `plan_type` property for selecting a make-up offer/service workflows based on user needs or preferences
    
    try {
        const subscription = await Subscription.create(req.body); 
        
        return res.status(201).json(subscription);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Subscription creation error:', error);
        throw new Error('Error creating a subscription'); // Replace with proper JWT or token-based authentication handling logic as needed for your system's auth strategy 
    }
});

This is for opportunity: Make.com Scenario Generation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
