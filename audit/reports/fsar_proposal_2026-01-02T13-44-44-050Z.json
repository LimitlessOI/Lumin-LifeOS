This step is beyond simple JavaScript implementation; however, it's worth noting that this system could leverage a lightweight model like k-nearest neighbors for predictive analysis:\n\nThis is for opportunity: Personalized AI Coaching Programs\nMake sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.",
