- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.css with this complete content:

require('dotenv').config(); // For environment variables handling in development setup only, use a separate `.env` file for production with sensitive data like Stripe keys
const express = require('express');
const { Pool } = require('pg');
const stripe = require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY); // Ensure you have a .env file or environment variables for production setup with sensitive data like Stripe keys set up accordingly in the CI/CD pipeline and never pushed to public repositories, only shared within secure company environments
const cors = require('cors');

// Initialize Express app
const app = express();
app.use(express.json()); // For parsing application/json
app.use(cors({origin: '*'})); // CORS settings for frontend, adjust as per your setup needs (not recommended in production)

// Stripe endpoint for logging transactions without handling sensitive data directly on the site
const incomeLogStripeEndpoint = require('./income_log');

// Database connection pooling to interact with Neon PostgreSQL database using Sequelize ORM setup separately (setup not shown here)
const sequelize = new Pool(); // Placeholder, replace this line in your actual code by initializing a proper Sequelize instance and configuring it for the 'neon' schema accordingly.

This is for opportunity: Automation Optimization Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
