# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_79cd924e-5118-425e-b136-96f225436884
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T02:45:12.770Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file /routes/index.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
require('dotenv').config(); // Load environment variables 
// Include all the above routes here... (Express.js route handlers) ...
module.exports = { /* Express router */ };

This is for opportunity: Game Overlay Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
