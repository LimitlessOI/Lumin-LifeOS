- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_10.js with this complete content:

// src/utils/loggingUtils.js content goes here including the implementation of necessary helper methods for generating alerts or messages based on design details provided above (optional). -- to be auto-generated using `touch ./src/utils/loggingUtils.js` command if not already present with standard structure and logic as per requirement specifications

This is for opportunity: Stripe Integration Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
