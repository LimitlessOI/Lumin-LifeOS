idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_9.js with this complete content:

#### MakeExpertServiceModule #### (Example backend NodeJS module) - Note that this snippet assumes the use of an ORM like Sequelize or Mongoose in your setup.

This is for opportunity: Make.com Scenario Consultation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
