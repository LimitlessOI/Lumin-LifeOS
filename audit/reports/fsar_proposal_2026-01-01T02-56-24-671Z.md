idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/001_create_table_artists.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS artists (
    artist_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    bio TEXT,
    social_links JSONB
);

ALTER TABLE artists OWNER TO lifeosai; -- Assuming 'lifeosai' is the username of an authorized user on Neon PostgreSQL.

This is for opportunity: AI-Generated Artwork for NFTs
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
