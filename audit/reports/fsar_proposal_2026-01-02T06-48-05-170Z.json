  "proposal": "self_improvement:  To address the issues identified, we need to focus on several key areas with targeted improvements. Here are some specific, actionable suggestions:\n\n1. **Codebase Cleanup and Refactoring:**\n   - **Issue 1: Missing Column in Database Table**\n     - The error logs indicate that the column `ai_model` is missing from the `execution_tasks` table. This needs to be added immediately to prevent future task execution failures.\n     - Actionable Step: Add the `ai_model` column to the `execution_tasks` table in PostgreSQL.\n   - **Issue 2: Performance Bottlenecks**\n     - The performance issues are primarily due to long average durations for implementing ideas, executing idea implementations, and self-improvement tasks.\n     - Actionable Step: Implement a more efficient data structure or algorithm for handling task scheduling and execution. Consider using distributed processing frameworks like Apache Kafka or Celery for better scalability and faster task handling.\n   - **Issue 3: Blind Spots Detection**\n     - The high number of blind spots detected (24529) indicates potential gaps in our system's functionality or data collection.\n     - Actionable Step: Conduct a thorough review of all current data pipelines to identify and fill these gaps. This includes enhancing error handling, improving logging, and ensuring that all relevant data is being collected consistently across the board.\n\n2. **Monetization Flows Improvement:**\n   - To reduce friction in monetization flows, consider implementing automated payout features using Stripe integration for faster and more reliable revenue tracking and distribution.\n   - Improve ROI visibility by enhancing reporting tools to provide real-time analytics on income streams and performance metrics. This will help stakeholders understand the impact of their decisions on overall profitability.\n\n3. **Safety and Ethics:**\n   - Ensure that all AI models used in task execution are ethically compliant and have appropriate safety mechanisms in place to prevent harm or unintended consequences.\n   - Implement regular audits and updates to privacy policies, data usage guidelines, and user agreements to maintain trust with users and comply with legal requirements.\n\n4. **Optimization of Code Execution:**\n   - To reduce the duration for implementing ideas and executing idea implementations, consider optimizing existing codebase using modern programming practices such as asynchronous processing, caching mechanisms, or microservices architecture if appropriate.\n   - For self-improvement tasks, leverage machine learning models trained to predict optimal paths based on historical data and performance metrics to guide continuous improvement without manual intervention.\n\nBy addressing these specific areas with actionable steps, we can not only resolve the immediate issues but also enhance the overall robustness, efficiency, and ethical considerations of our system.",
