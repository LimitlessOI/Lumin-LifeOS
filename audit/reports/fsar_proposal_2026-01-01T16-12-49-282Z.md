- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file components/Dashboard.js with this complete content:

import React from 'react';
import BusinessList from './BusinessList';
import ConsultationsForm from './ConsultationsForm';
// Additional imports as necessary for component functionality, e.g., useState and other hooks or components like Card if needed to display individual businesses/consultation options etc.. 
export default function Dashboard() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Automation Workflow Consulting</h1>
            <BusinessList />
            <ConsultationsForm />
            // Additional components for displaying revenue tracking, etc. as necessary based on your system requirements and design choices 
        </div>
    );
}

This is for opportunity: Automation Workflow Consulting
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
