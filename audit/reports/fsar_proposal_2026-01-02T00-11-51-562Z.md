idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.sql with this complete content:

-- File: migrations/2023_04_15_create_transactions_table.sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS transactions (
    transaction_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT REFEREN0ED users(user_id),
    source_id INT REFERENCES income_sources(source_id),
    amount NUMERIC CHECK (amount > 0),
    timestamp BIGINT UNIQUE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, -- Assuming use of UTC for simplicity in this example. Adjust as necessary based on the time zone settings within Railway's robust-magic environment.
    FOREIGN KEY(user_id) REFERENCES users(userdependent=True):

This is for opportunity: Automated Income Tracking Tools
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
