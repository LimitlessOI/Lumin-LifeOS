- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file middlewares/jwtMiddleware.js with this complete content:

const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken'); // Require the JSON Web Token library if needed for handling JWTs as stated in '012_create_table' SQL statement above; otherwise, this can be omitted based on actual security requirements and protocol specified by LifeOS AI Council team members earlier.
const expressJwt = require('express-jwt'); // This is a common middleware for handling JWT authentication with Express apps... 
// ... Implementation details of the jwtMiddleware function to validate tokens against user data from database or session storage would go here, based on actual security protocols established in project documentation provided by LifeOS AI Council team members earlier.

This is for opportunity: Digital Product Development Consulting
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
