- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file components/ProjectManagementComponent.js with this complete content:

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
// ... additional imports and logic required...
const ProjectManagement = () => {
    // Component state setup using useState hooks for project data management with conditional rendering based on role access control...
};
export default ProjectManagement;

This is for opportunity: Code Generation Platform
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
