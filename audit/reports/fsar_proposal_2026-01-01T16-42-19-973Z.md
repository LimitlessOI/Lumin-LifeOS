# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_19ed90cf-793a-4d41-9c99-2ddde86fcd7e
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T16:42:19.973Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file config/express.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
require('dotenv').config(); // Load environment variables for sensitive data (e.g., Stripe secret key)
const billingRoute = require('./routes/api/billing')(express()); -- Assuming your routes are set up to take an Express app instance as a parameter, allowing you to mount them on the main app object during setup in another file not shown here for brevity. 
// ... Additional configuration and middleware initialization code...

This is for opportunity: Rapid Business Duplication Consulting
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
