# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_d0dc0c15-ae31-4e89-a5d3-7fbf067c6007
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T01:11:47.102Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file db/migrations/2023_create_overlay_items_table.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS overlay_items (
    overlayID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    gameTitle VARCHAR(191) NOT NULL,
    itemName VARCHAR(191) NOT NULL,
    price NUMERIC(8, 2) CHECK (price > 0) NOT NULL
);

This is for opportunity: Game Overlay Distribution
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
