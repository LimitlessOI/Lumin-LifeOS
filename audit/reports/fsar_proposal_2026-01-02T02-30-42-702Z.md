# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_08170c2a-321d-4417-8034-d6e9dd1514be
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T02:30:42.702Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.js with this complete content:

const { StripeAPIInterface } = require('./payment'); // This module would contain the API logic to interact with Stripe and Neon PostgreSQL DB schema, not provided here for brevity but essential in implementation.

module.exports = new StripeAPIInterface();

This is for opportunity: Stripe Funnel Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
