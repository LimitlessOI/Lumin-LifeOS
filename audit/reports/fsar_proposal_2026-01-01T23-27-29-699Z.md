- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file controllers/tasksController.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
// ... additional controllers...
exports.addTask = async (req, res) => { /* Implementation of adding a task */ };
exports.assignTask = async (req, res) => { /* implementation for assigning tasks with user authorization checks and proper response codes */ };
// Additional controller functions as required by the system design...

This is for opportunity: LifeOS Automation Consultancy
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
