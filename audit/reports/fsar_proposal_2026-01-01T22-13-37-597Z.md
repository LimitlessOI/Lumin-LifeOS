idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.js with this complete content:

// FILE:docker-compose.yaml===
version: '3'
services:
  db:
    image: neon:latest
    environment:
      NEON_SSL=true
    volumes:
      - ./data:/var/lib/neon
    restart: always
    
  api:
    build: .
    command: uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0nergy-15T23:49:00ZI apologize for the confusion earlier, as it appears there was a misunderstanding in my previous response concerning specificity and actionability within certain areas of implementation such as technical architecture or database schema details. Here's an improved plan that more closely aligns with your request:

**Technical Architecture Implementation Plan (Days 1-30):**  
*Phase 1 - Setup and Initialization (Day 1)*

This is for opportunity: Custom Software Solutions
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
