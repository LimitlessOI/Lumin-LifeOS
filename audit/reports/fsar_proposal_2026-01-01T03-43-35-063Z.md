- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_6.css with this complete content:

// File: routes/api.js
const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
const { getSEOAnalysis, generateOptimizationRecommendations } = require('../controllers/seoController'); // Assume these are defined in seoController module
router.get('/seo_analysis', getSEOAnalysis);
router.post('/generate_optimization_recommendations', (req, res) => {
    const recommendationsData = generateOptimizationRecommendations(req.body.websiteUrl).then(data => 
        res.status(200).json({ success: true, data })
    );
});
// ... More routes as needed...
module.exports = router;

This is for opportunity: Instant Website Audit and Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
