idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/002_create_courses.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS courses (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    syllabus JSONB,
    expertise_required TEXT[],
    duration INTERVAL DAY TO MONTH,
    status VARCHAR CHECK (status in ('draft', 'published')),
    enrolment_limit INT DEFAULT 10
);

This is for opportunity: Online Course Creation for Automation Tools
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
