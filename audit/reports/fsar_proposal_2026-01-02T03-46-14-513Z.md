- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.sql with this complete content:

// routes/api.js (Express Router file for API endpoints)
const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
const db = require('../db'); // hypothetical database client module

router.get('/campaigns', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const campaignData = await db.query(`SELECT * FROM CampaignData`);
    return res.json(campaignData);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching campaign data:', error);
    res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
 0x1B, "\u001B[39;42m] ")) # Red on black text in the terminal for emphasis (ansi escape code)
# This line prints a red-on-black colored message to indicate that we are done with setting up our AI system. 
print(f"\u001B[39;42m] Revenue capture mechanism is now set.", end='') # End of the terminal output for this status update (ansi escape code)

This is for opportunity: AI-Driven Marketing Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
