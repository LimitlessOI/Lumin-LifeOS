# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_bcf5e423-69d0-475f-9a56-2981446fbe3d
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T21:28:12.391Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api/v1/payments.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const { processPayment, getAllPayments } = require('../controllers/paymentController'); // Assume these functions are implemented in payment controller 

router.post('/', processPayment); // Process a new payment; Include logic for creating or updating payments and handling status updates (omitted here)
router.get('/all', getAllPayments); // Retrieve all payments with their associated user details, currency information etc.

This is for opportunity: Stripe Integration Optimization
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
