- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/2019_06_05_init_clients_table.sql with this complete content:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS clients (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    stripePublicKey TEXT NOT NULL, -- Stripe public key for payment processing integration
    businessType ENUM('E-commerce', 'Service') DEFAULT 'E-commerce' CHECK (businessType IN ('E-commerce', 'Service')) STORED AS JSONB, -- Business type with a default value of E-commerce and data stored as jsonb to facilitate complex queries later on
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now() GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY, -- Generated always for auto-updating timestamp of the last update to client profile
    FOREIGN KEY (created_by) REFERENCES users(id) ON UPDATE CASCADE SAVE STATEMENT 'CREATE INDEX clients_businessType ON clients USING gin (JSONB_PARSE_KEYS(businessType::jsonb))' -- Creating an index on business type for optimized querying
);
```

This is for opportunity: AI-Enhanced Stripe Integration Consulting
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
