idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_12.js with this complete content:

# FILE:docker-compose.yaml=== Create a multi-container setup using Docker Compose to deploy our FastAPI service and PostgreSQL database in an isolated environment, leveraging the Railway platform for orchestration (maintaining 'light_tasks'). The configuration will include necessary networks, volumes, and persistent storage options tailored for scaling up withstandability.

This is for opportunity: Custom Software Solutions
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
