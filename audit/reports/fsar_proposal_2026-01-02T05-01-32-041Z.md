# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_4849bd01-00d4-4870-b14e-6d73975f7879
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T05:01:32.041Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file server/routes/index.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const taskRoutes = require('./tasks/routes');
// ... more required modules...

module.exports = function(app) {
    app.use('/api/v1', tasks); // Middleware for route prefixing, change as necessary
};

This is for opportunity: Remote Team Management Software
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
