# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_4d2179a9-f454-467d-bd3b-4e7b3af553c8
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T00:42:28.030Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file services/revenue-capture.js with this complete content:

const stripe = require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET); // Ensure to set this environment variable in Railway's production settings before rollout...
// ... Revenue capture logic using Stripe API calls, integrating with user progress and engagement data for blind spot detection recommendations...

This is for opportunity: Personalized Learning Platforms
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
