- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_10.js with this complete content:

// FILE:schema_migrations/versions/001.sql=== Develop SQL scripts for initial migrations needed at the setup phase, like creating a users table with basic attributes and permissions which will be expanded upon in subsequent phases to accommodate complex project requirements (maintaining 'monitoring').

This is for opportunity: Custom Software Solutions
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
