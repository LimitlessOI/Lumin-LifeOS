idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.css with this complete content:

// routes/api.js - Express routing for API endpoints
const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();

router.post('/chatbot/interactions', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        // Placeholder logic to initiate a customer interaction with the AI chatbot
        const response = await ChatInteractionService.startConversation(req.body);
        
        if (!response.success) {
            return res.status(400).send({ message: 'Failed to start conversation' });
        }
        
        // Logic for capturing necessary information post Stripe integration setup would go here (not implemented as it depends on future phase 5 details and is not part of the current technical architecture plan)
        
        return res.status(201).send({ message: 'Interaction started successfully' });
    } catch (error) {
        return res.status(500).send({ error: 'An internal server error occurred', details: error.message() });
    }}
router.put('/system/self-program', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        // Placeholder logic for self-programming the AI system to extend learning capabilities without disrupting service operations would go here
        
        return res.status(201).send({ message: 'Self-programming endpoint accessed successfully' });
    } catch (error) {
        return res.status(500).send({ error: 'An internal server error occurred', details: error.message() });
}}}
module.exports = router;

This is for opportunity: Custom AI Chatbot Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
