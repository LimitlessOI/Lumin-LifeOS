- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.js with this complete content:

// File: api/routes/api.js
const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();

router.post('/user', createUserHandler); // Placeholder function to be implemented with actual logic
router.get('/users/:id', getUserByIdHandler); // Placeholder function to be implemented with actual logic
// Additional CRUD operations for users will go here...

This is for opportunity: Digital Product Launch Kit
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
