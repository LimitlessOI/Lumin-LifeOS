# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_c2b4e61d-1a4b-41db-8281-1fa76459b310
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T01:46:24.283Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file config/server-config.json with this complete content:

{ "apiBaseUrl": "/v1", "envFilePath": "./.env" } // JSON object containing configuration for API routes, environment variables path among others

This is for opportunity: E-commerce Chatbot Integration
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
