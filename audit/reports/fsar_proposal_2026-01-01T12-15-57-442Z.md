- id: fsar_7cb017a1-cc2e-46b6-aa1b-42f1ac20e793
- timestamp: 2026-01-01T12:15:57.442Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
const { queueTask } = require('../controllers/taskQueueController'); // assuming a controller exists for queuing tasks
router.post('/api/v1/task_queue', taskQueue);
module.exports = router;

This is for opportunity: Online Funnel Optimization Service
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
