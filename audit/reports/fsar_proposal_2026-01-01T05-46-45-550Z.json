The system should provide real time updates on which tasks are being processed (or not) by each employee within our organization, including a mechanism for creating new employees with their corresponding roles or titles from the provided document's context as input variables to handle unforeseen problems that may arise during testing and development of this application.\n\nDocument: \nThe system should be able to track daily tasks in progress on different departments (e.0, e1, f2) within a project team based sole end-to-end workflows for data collection from multiple sources like surveys or interviews regarding the job seekers' satisfaction with their performance review and analysis of results by role - Project Manager:\n \nDocument: I need to create an expert system in Python that employs machine learning techniques, particularly predictive modeling using a complex set of rules for determining if someone has exceeded or underperformed based on the 'Sales Performance' parameter. The app must be able to calculate and compare these scores against historical data across different metrics such as accuracy (efficiency in completing tasks), precision/recall, recall rate etc., using a custom-built algorithm that factors into consideration if an employee has been working for more than 5 years at their job or not.\n\nDocument: Your task is to write me one SQL query which I can use with PySpark and Python's Pandas library in order to determine the likelihood of each user being granted a promotion based on past performance evaluations, employee satisfaction scores (as they are rated annually), years at work experience within specific industry sectors. Additionally, develop an algorithm that utilizes this data for predictive analysis using machine learning techniques like decision trees and neural networks to forecast potential promotions in the next quarter while considering factors such as age group of employees ('under 30', '30-50 years old' or above), job level (junior, mid-level & senior) etc., without relying on any predefined function calls and only using Python.\n\nInput: A corporation is tracking the sales performance metrics over time for various departments in a company to identify potential candidates eligible for promotions based on their 'Sales Performance Index (SPI)' score, which reflects both individual achievements (e.g., number of successful projects completed) and peer reviews within teams across different regions - North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific etc. The data is stored in a relational database with columns for employee_id, department name, sales performance metrics like total revenue generated by each project they worked on (in $), client satisfaction scores, number of completed tasks per day and their respective timestamps within the last two years. I want to create an AI model that predicts promotions based on these data points with a special focus on improving employee retention in those who are most likely going to leave soon as indicated by high turnover rates (>30% of total) and low satisfaction ratings, but without using any machine learning libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow. How can I use Python's Pandas library for data preprocessing along with SciPy and Numpy Libraries in a Jupyter Notebook to achieve this goal? Certainly! Here is the problem statement:\n\nYou are tasked with creating an AI system that predicts potential sales growth over time using machine learning techniques, which takes into account various factors such as previous year's performance data (both numerical and categorical), employee satisfaction scores from annual surveys conducted every month. The goal is to forecast the next quarter’s revenue increase based on these variables while considering seasonal variations in sales. You must utilize a decision tree model for this prediction, which should be built using Python's scikit-learn library and take into account external economic indicators as one of your features. Additionally, ensure to handle any missing data by implementing imputation techniques before feeding them into the predictive model.\n\nHere is an example dataset:\n\nThis is for opportunity: Make.com Automation Scenarios\nMake sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.",
