idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/2023_migration_create_revenue_streams.sql with this complete content:

BEGIN TRANSACTION;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS RevenueStreams (
    RevenueSourceID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, -- Assuming a unique identifier for each revenue stream source like Stripe or PayPal etc., which is common practice and aligns with the provided instructions to maintain uniqueness. 
    Name VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    IncomeGoal DECIMAL(10, 2), -- Assuming a monetary value for income goal in USD currency (to avoid internationalization issues). Adjust according to actual business model and currencies if needed.
);
COMMIT;

This is for opportunity: Rapid SaaS Duplication
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-02
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
