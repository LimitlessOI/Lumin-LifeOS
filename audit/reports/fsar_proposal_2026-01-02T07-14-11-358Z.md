- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_2.js with this complete content:

#### Step 2: Create a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) to manage caching policies and rules through Kubernetes Secrets Store API. You can set rate limits directly in the NGINX configuration or via annotations/sidecar injection, but this will require more complex configurations which are beyond simple template generation instructions; I'll provide guidance assuming you have Redis installed for session-based rate limiting:

This is for opportunity: QuickStart Automation Services
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
