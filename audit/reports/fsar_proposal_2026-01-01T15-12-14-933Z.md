- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file services/api.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
// ... other necessary imports like session, bodyParser... 
const User = require('../models/User'); // Assuming we have a user model based on our SQL migrations above
const Course = require('../models/Course');
const Enrollment = require('../models/Enrollment');
// ... other necessary imports like csrf, jsonwebtoken... 
let corsOptions;
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') { // Adjust for production settings if needed
    corsOptions = { origin: true };
} else {
    corsOptions = {};
}
const createCourseRoute = express.Router();
// ... Implement other routes such as GET /api/v1/courses, POST /api/v1/enrollments for user signups... 
createCourseRoute.post('/', async (req, res) => {
    // Business logic to create a new course or update an existing one with AI assistance goes here
});
router.use(createCourseRoute);
// ... Set up other routes and middleware as per the detailed plan... 
module.exports = router;

This is for opportunity: Online Course Creation for Automation Tools
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
