- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file payment-logic/index.js with this complete content:

const stripe = require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY); // Load secret key from environment variable for security purposes. 
// ... complete file content with functions to handle Stripe payments and integrate them into the revenue capture logic...

This is for opportunity: AI-Driven Income Drones
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
