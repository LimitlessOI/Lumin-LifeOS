# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_d80ed59e-f3b8-46aa-81aa-09764254520c
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T00:42:27.924Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file routes/api/v1/payments.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const router = new express.Router();
const stripe = require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET); // Ensure to set this environment variable in Railway's production settings 
router.post('/', async (req, res) => { /* Handle POST for payment processing with Stripe */ });
// ... additional routes and logic as necessary...

This is for opportunity: Personalized Learning Platforms
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
