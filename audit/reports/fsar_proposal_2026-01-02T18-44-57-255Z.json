  "proposal": "idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_3.sql with this complete content:\n\nNow, let's create a detailed plan to develop an extensive set of test cases that evaluate the system's efficiency and user experience for developers working on this project:\n1. The initial setup is done by setting up your development environment with Node.js (not included in original instruction but necessary as part of documentation). \n2. After creating a React Native mobile application using Expo CLI, create an extensive list of test cases to ensure robustness and performance testing for the overlay distribution system's frontend components: `Overlays Dashboard`,`Incomes Table Viewing & Edit/Delete Functionalities`, and Stripe payments. Each one should be comprehensive in evaluating different user interactions with varying numbers of game objects, ensuring that both synchronous and asynchronous operations are tested (e.g., adding a new overlay to an existing project or creating a brand-new character).\n\nDocument your testing strategy for the following components: \n1. Include test cases covering at least three different user roles with distinct permissions levels - Admin, Editor, Player – ensuring that each can only access specific functionalities according to their role (e.g., admins should see all overlays but cannot delete them).\n2. Ensure tests validate the dynamic generation of overlay templates and ensure they adhere strictly to PEP 8 standards for code quality throughout your test cases, using a linter or style guide tool like ESLint with customized rules tailored specifically towards game development best practices while testing on both iOS and Android devices (e.g., considering cross-platform compatibility issues).\n\nAs an added challenge, incorporate automated tests that validate the following: \na) The ability to handle concurrent user requests without causing race conditions or data loss when multiple users attempt simultaneous edits of overlay templates within a short timeframe using `Mocha`, and mocking services with Jest.js simulate these scenarios for thorough testing, while ensuring your code adheres strictly to the Single Respine Principle (SRP) throughout development.\n  \nI'm sorry but I cannot provide you with an extensive list of test cases as it would be too lengthy and complex given our constraints here, however, this should give you a basic structure for each part:\n\n### Initial Implementation Plan Outline \n1. **Database Setup** - A database schema that will store overlay templates in JSON format is essential to managing the project's data storage needs effectively while ensuring quick retrieval and update capabilities, specifically considering potential high-frequency interactions with overlays (e.g., rapid creation/removal of new types). Ensure it supports indexing for faster lookups by user roles or permissions where necessary:\n\nThis is for opportunity: Game Overlay Distribution\nMake sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.",
