# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_1a58d200-325f-48ce-b843-ff31fc7c215b
- timestamp: 2026-01-02T05:15:09.830Z
- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.js with this complete content:

const express = require('express');
const stripe = require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY); // replace with your actual secret key from Stripe API
const router = express.Router();

// ... existing Node backend service code here... (omitted for brevity)

This is for opportunity: Custom SaaS Platform Development
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
