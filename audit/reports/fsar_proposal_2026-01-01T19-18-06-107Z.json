  "proposal": "self_improvement:  To address the issues identified, we need to focus on improving both the backend infrastructure and operational processes while ensuring compliance with safety and ethical standards. Here are specific, actionable improvements:\n\n### 1. Reducing Friction in Monetization Flows\n**Issue:** The recent errors related to task execution failures suggest a potential issue with database schema or table structure that might be causing friction during the monetization process.\n\n**Improvement:**\n- **Database Migration Plan:** Implement a database migration script to add the missing `ai_model` column to the `execution_tasks` table. This will ensure smooth task execution and reduce errors.\n  - Script: Run an ALTER TABLE command to add the `ai_model` column if it does not exist, setting a default value or type that fits your application's needs.\n- **Validation Checks:** Add validation checks in the codebase to verify database schema integrity before running tasks. This will prevent future errors due to missing columns.\n\n### 2. Improving ROI Visibility\n**Issue:** The performance metrics indicate longer average durations for implementing ideas and self-improvement, which could be a bottleneck in tracking ROI effectively.\n\n**Improvement:**\n- **Optimize Data Collection:** Implement more efficient data collection methods that minimize the time taken to generate reports and updates on ROI. Consider using caching mechanisms or batch processing for faster data retrieval.\n- **Automated Alerts:** Set up automated alerts based on predefined performance thresholds. This will help in proactive management of ROI, ensuring quick response to any significant changes.\n\n### 3. Keeping Safety and Ethics Intact\n**Issue:** Blind spots detected (13989) suggest potential areas where safety or ethical considerations might not be fully addressed.\n\n**Improvement:**\n- **Ethical AI Training Data Filtering:** Enhance the data filtering process for training AI models to exclude unethical, biased, or harmful content. Implement regular audits and updates of this filter using feedback loops from users and stakeholders.\n- **Code Review and Compliance Checks:** Regularly perform code reviews and compliance checks to ensure that all new features and updates adhere to safety and ethical guidelines. This includes both internal policies and external regulatory requirements if applicable.\n\n### Implementation Strategy:\n1. **Prioritize the tasks based on severity of impact (e.g., migration plan is critical for immediate error resolution).**\n2. **Implement changes incrementally where possible** to minimize disruption while testing new processes in a staging environment before full deployment.\n3. **Monitor the effects of these improvements closely**, using key performance indicators (KPIs) and user feedback to assess effectiveness and make further refinements as necessary.\n\nBy addressing these specific areas, we can enhance both operational efficiency and system safety, ensuring sustained performance and ethical compliance in our service offerings.",
