The deployment command would look something like this in a terminal session (this is pseudocode):\n\n```shell\nr-cli build && r-run --env=production  # Set environment to 'production' and deploy using Railway’s CLI or CI pipeline configurations already established within `workflows/node.yml` for GitHub Actions integration.\n\nThis is for opportunity: Game Development for Overlay Distribution\nMake sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.",
