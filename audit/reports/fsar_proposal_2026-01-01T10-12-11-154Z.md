# FSAR Proposal Report
- id: fsar_c4767e01-32fc-45e9-b0e0-284d6bfc09e4

- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file generated_1.js with this complete content:

// routes/api.js ===START OF AI RESPONSE OMITTED FOR BREVITY, ADDITIONAL CODE FOLLOWS===
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const stripe = require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY);
const db = require('../db/connection'); // Hypothetical database connection module for Neon PostgreSQL or similar setup in Railway environment

// Unit tests using PyTest and mocks (assuming we have a test runner configured with necessary tools)
/* 
- Assume unit testing files are set up separately as per the Testing Strategy section. Examples of such files would include:
*/
require('../tests/unit_tests'); // Hypothetical file containing all PyTest suite for our application functions and endpoints; this is outside scope but necessary to mention in a real-world scenario. 
/* ===END OF AI RESPONSE OMITTED FOR BREVITY=== */

This is for opportunity: Digital Product Duplication & Enhancement
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
