- severity: 6
- block_execution: false
- proposal:

idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/001_create_tables.sql with this complete content:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS customers (
    customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100), 
    email VARCHAR(150) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    preferences JSONB
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS interactions (
    interaction_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT REFERENCES customers(customer_id),
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, 
    message JSONB NOT NULL -- Contains structured data from conversation with the bot and user inputs.
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS kb (
    question TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    answer TEXT
);

This is for opportunity: Automated Customer Support Chatbots
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2028-01-01
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
