idea_implementation: Create or update the file migrations/create_webinars_schema.rb with this complete content:

```ruby
    class CreateWebinarsSchema < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0]
      def change
        create_table :webinars, id: :serial do |t|
          t.timestamps null: false, default: -> { 'NOW' }
          
          # Attendee fields...
          # Sessions and feedback tables with foreign keys to webinars table for efficient queries...
        end
        
        add_index :webinars, [:event_date, :start_time], unique: true
      end

This is for opportunity: Webinar and Event Automation
Make sure the file is complete, working, and production-ready.

## Risks
- Slow failure: unnoticed degradation accumulating by 2027-12-31
- Unintended consequence: incentives shift toward short-term metrics, long-term reliability decays
- Incentive drift: stakeholders habituate to optimistic outputs, raising risk of silent defects

## Mitigations
- Add scheduled adversarial audits with hard pass/fail gates
- Track leading indicators for drift and trust inflation; alert on trend change
- Prefer reversible rollouts; keep rollback artifacts warm and tested
